#### Today’s hiring challenges require a multi-pronged approach
#### 应对当今人才招聘的挑战需要方法上多管齐下
The survey results highlight the difficulties organizations face in hiring technical talent in today's tight labor market. While 
it is tempting for some companies to rely solely on external recruitment efforts to address the shortage, the data suggests 
this may not be enough. Instead, alternative approaches such as upskilling existing employees, offering increased salaries, 
improving work / life balance, and providing opportunities to work on open source projects can effectively attract and 
retain top talent.

调查结果凸显了在当今劳动力市场紧张的情况下，组织在招聘技术人才方面面临的困难。 虽然一些公司很想仅仅依靠外部招聘来解决人才短缺问题，但数据表明这可能还不够。 相反，提高现有员工的技能、提高工资、改善工作/生活平衡以及提供从事开源项目的机会等替代方法可以有效地吸引和留住顶尖人才。

Organizations need to be creative in their approach to hiring and consider alternative solutions to overcome the chal-
lenges posed by the current tech talent shortage.

#### Organizations need streamlined hiring and onboarding processes
#### 组织需要简化招聘和入职流程
The data reveals that organizations must streamline their hiring and onboarding processes to reduce turnover rates 
and increase efficiency. Even with efficient processes in place, recruitment and onboarding remain time-consuming. 
High turnover rates suggest it might be better to focus on upskilling existing employees rather than relying on external 
recruitment efforts.

数据显示，组织必须简化招聘和入职流程，以降低人员流动率并提高效率。 即使制定了高效的流程，招聘和入职仍然很耗时。 高流动率表明，集中精力提高现有员工的技能可能比依赖外部招聘工作更好。

Improving onboarding and training programs can help organizations reduce turnover rates and ensure that new hires 
effectively integrate into the company culture and team dynamics.

改进入职和培训计划可以帮助组织降低流动率，并确保新员工有效融入公司文化和团队动态。
