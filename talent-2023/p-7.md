Organizational preparedness 
for economic uncertainty 
began in 2022
The hiring picture remains strong despite the widely 
publicized layoffs at technology vendors at the end of 
2022, which has extended at times into 2023. The top 
part of FIGURE 1 shows three views into how organi-
zations intend to address staffing: all organizations; 
a segmentation of the sample by end users, vendors 
/ service providers, and others; and selected indus-
tries. The overall assessment is positive, with 61% of 
organizations increasing staffing, 18% waiting to see 
how the economic uncertainty evolves, and just 19% 
implementing staff reductions. The most variability is 
shown at the individual industry level because of the 
narrower functional focus of each industry.


Hiring in the "telecommunications / Internet service 
provider (ISP) / web hosting" sector was particu-
larly strong, with 71% of organizations increasing 
their technical headcount. Most other organizations’ 
industries (not shown) also increased their technical 
headcounts. For more information on the industries 
represented in our sample, see TABLE A12.


The top part of FIGURE 1 shows that 66% of end-user 
organizations (those who primarily consume tech-
nology to support their business activities) were 
able to increase technical staff in 2022 compared to 
60% of technology vendors and service providers. 
End-user organizations also fared better in tech staff 
decreases, with 17% of their ranks reducing technical 
staff compared to 21% for technology vendors and 
service providers.
