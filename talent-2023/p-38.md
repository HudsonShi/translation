The 3rd panel in FIGURE 18 shows the distribution 
of organization types. 35% of our sample was clas-
sified as end-user organizations that primarily use 
(consume) IT products and services to support their 
business activities. This contrasts with vendors and 
service providers (55%), whose primary activity is 
creating horizontal and vertical IT products and 
services for sale to end users. This leaves 10% 
of organizations that are in academia, research, 
government, nonprofits, foundations, or other 
areas.
