### 关于本研究

From a research perspective, it was important to 
eliminate any perception of sample bias and ensure 
high data quality. We eliminated sample bias by 
sourcing 80% of our usable sample from a 3rd party 
panel provider and the remaining 20% from Linux 
Foundation membership. We addressed data quality 
through extensive pre-screening and screening 
criteria to ensure that respondents had sufficient 
familiarity and professional experience to answer 
questions accurately on behalf of the organization 
they worked for.

从研究的角度来看，消除样本偏差并确保高数据质量非常重要。 我们通过从第三方面板提供商处获得 80% 的可用样本，以及从 Linux 基金会会员处获得剩余的 20% 来消除样本偏差。 我们通过广泛的预筛选和筛选标准来解决数据质量问题，以确保受访者有足够的熟悉度和专业经验来代表其工作的组织准确回答问题。

The design of the worldwide survey conducted by 
Linux Foundation Training & Certification and Linux 
Foundation Research was to gather insights on the 
current trends and challenges related to technical 
talent hiring and management. We conducted the 
survey from February 23 through March 10, 2023, 
and we promoted it through various channels, 
including social media, the Linux Foundation and 
Linux.com websites, and the Linux Foundation 
Newsletter.

Linux 基金会培训与认证和 Linux 基金会研究进行的全球调查旨在收集有关技术人才招聘和管理的当前趋势和挑战的见解。 我们于 2023 年 2 月 23 日至 3 月 10 日进行了这项调查，并通过各种渠道进行了宣传，包括社交媒体、Linux 基金会和 Linux.com 网站以及 Linux 基金会新闻通讯。

To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the survey 
data, we also utilized a third-party panel provider 
to obtain 80% of the respondents. These respon-
dents received nominal compensation for their 
participation in the study. It is important to note 
that the screening of the survey participants was 
dependent on their employment status, and only 
those who were employed full-time were part of the 
study. Individuals who were not affiliated with any 
organization or were unable to talk about their orga-
nization's hiring plans and practices were not part of 
the survey.

为了确保调查数据的准确性和可靠性，我们还利用了第三方样本库提供商来获取 80% 的受访者。 这些受访者因参与研究而获得了象征性的报酬。 值得注意的是，调查参与者的筛选取决于他们的就业状况，并且只有那些全职工作的人才参与研究。 不隶属于任何组织或无法谈论其组织的招聘计划和做法的个人不属于调查范围。

In total, the survey received 437 responses. We 
removed 19 responses, as they could not provide 
answers to questions about the 2023 hiring trends. 
The final sample size used in most of the report was 
418 respondents. The margin of error for the survey 
data is + / - 4.9% at a 95% confidence level, indicating 
that the survey results are statistically significant 
and representative of the broader population.

该调查总共收到 437 份回复。 我们删除了 19 条回复，因为它们无法回答有关 2023 年招聘趋势的问题。 报告大部分内容使用的最终样本量为 418 名受访者。 调查数据的误差幅度为 +/- 4.9%（置信水平为 95%），表明调查结果具有统计显着性并代表了更广泛的人群。

### How missing data is handled
### 如何处理丢失的数据

Although the requirement is for respondents to 
answer nearly all questions in the survey (the only 
exceptions are the open-ended questions), there 
are times when a respondent is unable to answer 
a question because it is outside the scope of their 
role or experience. For this reason, we frequently 
add a DKNS response to the list of responses for 
a question. However, this creates a conundrum 
regarding what to do with DKNS responses.

尽管要求受访者回答调查中的几乎所有问题（唯一的例外是开放式问题），但有时受访者无法回答问题，因为该问题超出了他们的角色或经验范围。 因此，我们经常将 DKNS 响应添加到问题的响应列表中。 然而，这造成了一个关于如何处理 DKNS 响应的难题。

One approach is to treat it just like any other 
response. In this way, report readers can see the 
percentage of respondents that answered DKNS. 
The advantage of this approach is that it reports 
back the exact distribution of the data collected. The 
challenge with this approach is that it distorts the 
distribution of valid responses—those responses 
where respondents could answer the question.

一种方法是像对待任何其他响应一样对待它。 通过这种方式，报告读者可以看到回答 DKNS 的受访者的百分比。 这种方法的优点是它可以报告所收集数据的准确分布。 这种方法的挑战在于它扭曲了有效回答的分布——即受访者可以回答问题的那些回答。

Some of the analyses in this report excluded the 
DKNS. This can occur when the data missing can 
either be classified as missing at random (MAR) or 
missing completely at random (MCAR). Excluding 
DKNS data from a question does not change the 
distribution of data (counts) for the other responses, 
but it does change the size of the denominator used 
to calculate the percentage of responses across 
the remaining responses. This has the effect of 
proportionally increasing the percent values of the 
remaining responses relative to the number of DKNS 
responses. The number of valid cases is adjusted 
accordingly. Where we have elected to exclude 
DKNS data, a careful examination of the footnote for 
the figure will enable the reader to determine the 
number of DKNS responses based on the difference 
between the sample size (DKNS inclusive) and valid 
cases (DKNS excluded).

本报告中的一些分析排除了 DKNS。 当数据丢失可分类为随机丢失 (MAR) 或完全随机丢失 (MCAR) 时，可能会发生这种情况。 从问题中排除 DKNS 数据不会改变其他响应的数据（计数）分布，但会改变用于计算响应在其余响应中所占百分比的分母的大小。 这具有按比例增加剩余响应相对于 DKNS 响应数量的百分比值的效果。 有效案例数量相应调整。 在我们选择排除 DKNS 数据的情况下，仔细检查图中的脚注将使读者能够根据样本量（包括 DKNS）和有效案例（排除 DKNS）之间的差异来确定 DKNS 响应的数量。

Finally, percentage values in this report may not add 
up to exactly 100% due to rounding.

最后，由于四舍五入，本报告中的百分比值可能不会相加精确到100%。
