The bottom part of FIGURE 1 combines both invol-
untary (layoffs) and voluntary (retirements and
resignations) technical headcount reductions.
Layoffs often result in a redistribution of respon-
sibilities, which sometimes can be significant and
will precipitate additional resignations as remaining
staff evaluate their roles, workloads, and opportu-
nities. For this reason, FIGURE 1 staff reductions are
best described as turnover because of their volun-
tary and involuntary components. Vendor / service
provider organizations experienced very high
turnover, at 39%. Meanwhile, end-user organizations
averaged 25% turnover, more in line with typical pre-
pandemic levels.

图 1 的底部结合了非自愿（裁员）和自愿（退休和辞职）技术人员削减。 裁员通常会导致职责的重新分配，有时可能会造成重大影响，并会导致更多的辞职，因为剩余的员工会评估自己的角色、工作量和机会。 因此，图 1 中的人员削减是最好将其描述为流动率，因为其包含自愿和非自愿成分。 供应商/服务提供商组织的人员流动率非常高，达到 39%。 同时，终端用户组织平均流动率为 25%，与疫情爆发之前的典型水平基本保持一致。

company size (number of employees), see TABLE A17.

##The impact of economic concerns on technical staff hiring in 2023

## 经济担忧对2023年科技人才招聘的影响

Economic concerns beginning in 2022 and extending
into 2023 have impacted hiring plans, especially in
North America.

从 2022 年开始并持续到 2023 年的经济担忧影响了招聘计划，尤其是在北美。

As shown on the top half of FIGURE 2, 59% of
surveyed organizations reported revising their tech-
nical hiring plans in response to these concerns,
37% elected to leave their technical hiring plans
unchanged, and 4% said they didn't know or were not
sure (DKNS). The majority of organizations (59%) have
concerns about how to plan for 2023, but 41% did not
expressly state concerns about how the economy
would impact their technical hiring plans in 2023.

如图 2 上半部分所示，59% 的受访组织表示正在修改其技术招聘计划以应对这些担忧，37% 的组织选择保持其技术招聘计划不变，4% 的组织表示他们不知道或 不确定（DKNS）。 大多数组织 (59%) 担心如何规划 2023 年，但 41% 的组织对经济将如何影响其 2023 年的技术招聘计划没有明确表示

#### KEY TAKEAWAY

#### 要点

Despite the economic
concerns and layoffs that
have impacted the tech
industry, the 2023 State of
Tech Talent Survey data
suggests that hiring trends
remain strong, with the
ongoing demand for skilled
technical talent, especially
at the more entry level for
professionals with developer
skills. This is particularly
true for certain sectors, such
as cloud and telecommu-
nications, which continue
to play a critical role in the
technology adoption land-
scape. The outlook for hiring
in the tech industry remains
positive, with many organi-
zations planning to increase
their technical headcount in
the coming years.

尽管经济问题和裁员影响了科技行业，但 2023 年科技人才状况调查数据表明，招聘趋势依然强劲，对熟练技术人才的持续需求，特别是对具有开发技能的专业人士的入门级人才的需求。 对于某些行业尤其如此，例如如云和电信，它们继续在技术采用领域发挥着关键作用。科技行业的招聘前景依然充满希望，许多组织计划在接下来的几年里扩大他们的技术团队。
