《2023 技术人才状况报告》对组织内当前和未来的技术型人才配置要求和所需技能提供了宝贵的见解。
本报告基于 Linux 基金会培训与认证和 Linux 基金会研究团队在 2023 年 2 月和 3 月对 400 多名招聘经理和人事专员进行的一项全球调查，旨在满足最终用户组织和技术提供商的需求。


#### Impact of economic concerns
#### 经济问题的影响 

One of the report's key findings is 
the impact of economic concerns on 
technical hiring plans. More than 50% 
of organizations surveyed reported 
revising their hiring plans by freezing 
new positions. This is likely due to the 
ongoing global economic uncertainty 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
other factors, including inflation and 
geopolitical conflicts.

本报告的主要发现之一是经济问题对技术招聘计划的影响。超过 50% 的受访组织报告称，通过冻结新职位来修改招聘计划。这可能是由于新冠肺炎疫情和其他因素（包括通货膨胀和地缘政治冲突）造成的持续全球经济不确定性。


#### Demand for skilled technical talent
#### 对技术型人才的需求

More organizations plan to increase 
their technical staff than decrease. 
This is a positive sign for those seeking 
employment in the tech industry. The 
demand for skilled tech talent remains 
strong, particularly in newer areas such 
as cloud / containers, cybersecurity, 
and AI / ML. Respondents identified 
these areas as the primary focus for 
hiring in 2023.

更多的组织计划增加技术型人才，而不是减少。对于那些在科技行业寻找工作的人来说，这是一个积极的信号。对熟练技术人才的需求仍然强劲，尤其是在云/容器、网络安全和人工智能/机器学习等新领域。受访者认为这些领域是 2023 年招聘的重点。


#### Shift in technical roles
#### 技术角色的转变 

Another interesting finding is the shift 
in the types of technical roles being 
hired for. While senior technical roles 
have seen the biggest job cuts, new 
hiring focuses more on developers 
and IT management. This suggests 
organizations seek skilled individuals 
who can contribute to project imple-
mentation, management, and tech-
nical development.

另一个有趣的发现是被雇佣的技术角色类型的转变。虽然高级技术职位的裁员幅度最大，但新招聘更多地关注开发人员和IT管理。这表明组织寻求更有能力为项目实施、管理和技术发展做出贡献的技术人员。


#### Training and upskilling
#### 培训与技能提升

To address the changing hiring land-
scape, training and upskilling are 
becoming increasingly important strat-
egies for organizations. The report 
highlights that 70% of organizations 
surveyed provide training opportu-
nities for their existing technical staff 
on new technologies. This is a positive 
sign, as it suggests a commitment by 
organizations to the ongoing devel-
opment of their employees and 
keeping their staff up to date with the 
latest technologies and practices.
Upskilling is also becoming more 
important for recruitment purposes. 
When unable to find suitable tech-
nical candidates, organizations train 
existing employees more often than 
hiring consultants. This suggests that 
organizations recognize the value of 
investing in their existing staff and the 
challenges of finding the right external 
candidates.

为了应对不断变化的招聘环境，培训和技能提升正成为组织越来越重要的战略。该报告强调，70% 的受访组织为现有技术人员提供新技术培训机会。这是一个积极的信号，因为它表明各组织致力于员工的持续发展，并让员工了解最新的技术和实践。在招聘方面，提高技能也变得越来越重要。当找不到合适的技术候选人时，组织会更对现有员工进行培训，显著多于聘请顾问。这表明，各组织认识到对现有员工进行投资的价值，以及寻找合适的外部候选人的挑战。

#### Certification and preemployment testing
#### 认证与岗前测试

Respondents felt that certification and 
pre-employment testing are necessary 
to verify skills to address the chal-
lenges of finding the right candidate. 
This tool is useful to ensure organi-
zations hire the right people for the 
job. It also gives candidates a clear 
understanding of the skills they must 
demonstrate to succeed in the role.

受访者认为，认证和岗前测试对于验证技能是必要的，用于解决寻找合适候选人的难题。该工具有助于确保组织为该工作雇佣合适的人员。它还让候选人清楚地了解他们必须展示的技能，才能在这个角色中取得成功。
