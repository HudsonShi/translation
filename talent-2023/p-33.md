The survey reveals an interesting trend: 
Organizations that believe recent tech talent layoffs 
facilitate the identification of exceptional candi-

they expand their technical workforce. These roles, 
which could be viewed as senior technical staff, are 
of greater interest to 56% of these organizations 
compared to the average respondent, where only 
46% are looking to hire for IT management positions. 


KEY TAKEAWAY

reveals that training is essential for both 
increased and reduced hiring moves. 
Negative outcomes, such as increased 
workloads and longer time frames for

when organizations cut staff or pause 
hiring plans, and job cuts are blamed on 
revenue misses and economic caution. 
Furthermore, the types of staff most 
affected by staffing cuts are senior 
staff members, while developers and 
IT management are the most recruited 
roles.
