KEY TAKEAWAY


This year, the survey did not 
ask about the difficulty of 
finding professionals with open 
source-related skills because it 
has been consistently difficult 
for the past 10 years. However, 
the survey revealed the greater 
impact of onboarding and 
retaining new hires success-
fully. Strategic planning for tech-
nical staffing changes in 2023 
is crucial, and organizations 
should consider the impact on 
business operations and growth. 
To remain competitive and 
relevant, prioritizing software 
development, technical support, 
and staff training is essential. 
Organizations can position them-
selves for success in the dynamic 
digital landscape by being 
proactive in staffing changes.
