PART 1: THE TECHNICAL HIRING PICTURE IN 2023

## 第1部分：2023年技术招聘前景


KEY TAKEAWAY

关键要点


Organizations are generally reluctant 
to reduce technical staff, primarily 
due to the difficulty in finding, hiring, 
and retaining skilled technical talent. 
When faced with economic uncer-
tainty, organizations prefer imple-
menting a temporary hiring freeze 
and, if necessary, reducing compen-
sation rather than resorting to laying 
off staff. This brings up an important 
question about how organiza-
tions can keep their technical staff 
engaged and enhance their technical 
skills when hiring is not an option.

组织通常不愿意减少技术人员，主要是因为很难找到、招聘和保留熟练的技术人才。当面临经济不确定性时，组织更倾向于暂停招聘，必要时降薪，而不是裁员。这就提出了一个重要的问题，即在没有招聘的情况下，组织如何保持技术人员的敬业度并提高他们的技术能力。


At 8% overall, reductions alone were not the only 
strategy used to scale back technical staff. More 
complex strategies that involved reducing technical 
staff included:
•  Reducing staff and implementing a hiring 
freeze (6% overall)
•  Reducing staff, implementing a hiring freeze, 
and then hiring (4% overall)
•  Reducing staff and then hiring (2% overall)

总的来说，裁员8%并不是用来减少技术人员的唯一策略。更复杂的策略包括：
- 裁员，并暂停招聘（占比6%）
- 裁员，暂停招聘，然后再招聘（占比4%）
- 裁员后再招聘（占比2%）


While 20% of organizations overall did showcase 
strategies that involved staff reductions, 6 percentage 
points out of these 20 did involve hiring as well.

虽然20%的组织实施了涉及裁员的策略，但这20%的组织中有6%也涉及招聘。


Looking at the 59% of organizations that expressed 
economic concerns, the primary strategy for 
addressing these concerns was to freeze hiring 
(34%), followed by a focus on hiring (32%) and staff 
reductions (13%).

有59%的企业表达了对经济的担忧，解决这些担忧的主要策略是暂停招聘（34%），其次是专注于招聘（32%）和裁员（13%）。

This contrasts significantly with the 41% of organi-
zations that did not express economic concerns. 
Among these organizations, 62% only intended to 
increase hiring, followed by 24% that only indicated 
they would freeze hiring and just 2% that would 
primarily reduce their technical headcount.

这与41%没有表达经济担忧的组织形成鲜明对比。在这些组织中，62%只打算增加招聘，其次是24%只表示他们会暂停招聘，只有2%会主要减少技术人员。

## 2023年行业招聘计划的变化主要集中在增加或暂停招聘技术人员

Organizations across different industries reported 
mixed results in their hiring plans. Some industries 
showed growth, while others faced significant chal-
lenges, as shown in FIGURE 3. On average, 57% of all 
organizations reported increased hiring plans, indi-
cating cautious optimism about the future. However, 
46% of organizations also reported freezing staff 
hiring, and 20% were reducing staff, highlighting the 
continued uncertainty and challenges facing busi-
nesses. The reason these percentages do not add 
up to 100% is shown on the bottom part of FIGURE 2. 
Organizations sometimes pursue complex hiring 
strategies that initially combine a staff reduction or 
freeze on hiring with a later decision to hire all within 
a single year.

不同行业的企业在招聘计划上的表现喜忧参半。一些行业显示出增长，而另一些行业则面临重大挑战，如图3所示。平均57%的组织报告招聘计划增加，表明对未来持谨慎乐观态度。然而，46%的组织也表示暂停了员工招聘，20%的组织正在裁员，这凸显了企业面临的持续不确定性和挑战。这些百分比加起来没有达到100%的原因显示在图2的底部。组织有时会采取复杂的招聘策略，最初是裁员或暂停招聘，后来决定在一年内全部招聘。


The industries with the highest percentage of orga-
nizations planning to increase their workforce were
