## Foreword  
## 前言

I am thrilled to present the findings of the 2023 
State of Tech Talent Survey. This report is a 
valuable resource for organizations seeking to 
understand the current and future technology 
staffing requirements and skills needed within 
their teams.

我很高兴能公布 2023 技术人才状况调查的结果。对于寻求了解当前和未来技术人员配置要求以及团队所需技能的组织来说，这份报告是一份宝贵的资源。

The report sheds light on the impact of economic 
concerns on technical hiring plans, revealing that 
more than 50% of organizations surveyed have 
revised their hiring plans due to ongoing global 
economic uncertainty. However, the report also 
shows that despite these challenges, the demand 
for skilled tech talent remains strong, particularly 
in newer areas such as cloud / containers, cyber-
security, and AI / ML.

本报告揭示了经济问题对技术招聘计划的影响，显示超过 50% 的受访组织由于持续的全球经济不确定性而修改了招聘计划。然而，该报告还显示，尽管存在这些挑战，但对熟练技术人才的需求仍然强劲，尤其是在云/容器、网络安全和人工智能/机器学习等新领域。

Training and upskilling are essential strategies for 
organizations looking to address the changing 
hiring landscape. The report highlights that 70% 
of organizations surveyed provide training oppor-
tunities for their existing technical staff on new 
technologies, demonstrating a commitment to 
ongoing development and growth.

对于那些希望应对不断变化的招聘形势的组织来说，培训和提高技能是必不可少的策略。该报告强调，70% 的受访组织为现有技术人员提供新技术培训机会，表明他们致力于持续发展和增长。

Upskilling is becoming more important for 
recruitment, with organizations choosing to train 
existing employees more often than hiring consul-
tants when they cannot find suitable external 
candidates. This recognizes the value of investing 
in existing staff and the challenges of finding the 
right external candidates.

技能提升对招聘越来越重要，当组织找不到合适的外部候选人时，他们会更多地选择培训现有员工，而不是聘用顾问。这承认了对现有员工进行投资的价值，以及寻找合适的外部候选人的挑战。

The report also shows that certifications and 
pre-employment testing are becoming necessary 
tools for organizations to verify the skills of poten-
tial candidates. At Linux Foundation Training & 
Certification, we understand the importance of 
certifications in demonstrating technical profi-
ciency and validating expertise. We design our 
certification programs to equip individuals with 
the skills and knowledge needed to succeed 
in today's fast-paced tech industry and assure 
prospective employers that candidates demon-
strate the required skill sets.

报告还显示，认证和岗前测试正在成为组织验证潜在候选人技能的必要工具。在 Linux 基础培训和认证中，我们理解认证在展示技术熟练度和验证专业知识方面的重要性。我们设计认证计划，为个人提供在当今快节奏的科技行业取得成功所需的技能和知识，并向潜在雇主保证，候选人具备所需的成套技能。

As the tech industry evolves, we recognize the 
crucial role of ongoing learning and development 
in staying ahead of the curve. The 2023 State of 
Tech Talent Report provides valuable insights 
into the ongoing changes and challenges in the 
tech industry workforce. We encourage hiring 
managers to use this report as a resource in their 
training and staffing efforts and look forward 
to continuing to provide valuable research and 
training resources for the tech industry.

随着科技行业的发展，我们认识到持续学习和发展在保持领先方面的关键作用。《2023 技术人才状况报告》对科技行业劳动力的持续变化和挑战提供了宝贵的见解。我们鼓励招聘经理将这份报告作为培训和人事工作的资源，并期待着继续为科技行业提供宝贵的研究和培训资源。
