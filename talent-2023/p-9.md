The chart on the bottom part of  FIGURE 2 shows
the difference between those organizations where
the economic concerns caused a revision of plans
and those organizations that were not as concerned
about the economy and left their 2023 hiring
plans unchanged. The same figure also shows a
composite view when you combine all the organiza-
tions together. Various responses to the questions
included increasing staff, freezing staff hires,
reducing staff, or DKNS. Respondents could select
multiple responses. This chart, therefore, shows all
the possible response permutations in descending
order based on the overall composite view.

图 2 底部的图表显示了因经济担忧导致计划修订的组织与不那么担心经济并保持 2023 年招聘计划不变的组织之间的差异。该图表还显示了一个综合视图（把所有组织放在一起）。对问题的各种回答包括增加员工，冻结员工雇用，减少员工或DKNS。受访者可以选择多个答案。因此，该图表以综合视图为基础，按照降序方式显示所有可能的组合。

Perhaps the most interesting finding is that despite
economic headwinds, the overall composite view shows
more organizations were planning to increase their
staff in 2023 (44%) but did not anticipate any reductions
or freezes to balance those increases. Looking across all
the strategies that involved staff hiring, 56% of organi-
zations intended to hire in 2023 even if other activities
such as staff reductions or freezes were also involved.
This is encouraging and suggests that while organiza-
tions are economically concerned about 2023, they are
not amending their hiring plans.

也许最有趣的发现是，尽管经济形势不利，但总体综合观点显示，更多的组织计划在2023年增加员工(44%)，但预计不会有任何裁员或冻结来平衡这些增长。纵观所有涉及员工招聘的战略，即使涉及裁员或冻结员工等其他活动，56%的组织也打算在2023年招聘。这是令人鼓舞的，并表明虽然组织对 2023 年的经济状况感到担忧，但他们并不修改他们的招聘计划。

Part of the concern that does exist is expressed by
the 30% of organizations overall that elected to solely
put staffing freezes in place and the additional 6%
that were looking to first freeze and then hire, the
6% that were going to reduce staff and then freeze,
and finally the 4% looking to reduce, freeze, and then
ultimately hire. This shows that strategies involving
staff freezes were a preferred path forward in 2023
and represent a conservative but not overly punitive
approach to dealing with an uncertain economy.

确实存在的部分担忧是，30%的组织选择全面冻结招聘，6%的组织选择先冻结再招聘，6%的组织选择裁员后再冻结招聘，4%的组织选择裁员、冻结并最终招聘。这表明，涉及冻结员工的战略是2023年的首选路径，代表了一种保守但不是过度惩罚的方法，以应对不确定的经济。
