### Comprehensive training and certification programs should supplement hiring
### 全面的培训和认证计划应补充入招聘
The results of this year’s survey underscore the importance of investing in upskilling and certification opportunities to 
address the technical talent shortage. Certification and pre-employment testing can verify claimed technical skills while 
upskilling, effective onboarding, and certifications are highly valued and important for success.

今年的调查结果强调了投资于技能提升和认证机会以解决技术人才短缺问题的重要性。 认证和就业前测试可以验证所声称的技术技能，而技能提升、有效入职和认证对于成功而言非常有价值且重要。

While budgetary constraints are affecting both smaller and larger organizations in 2023, it is essential to recognize the 
value of training and certification in ensuring that technical staff possess the necessary skills to succeed in an increas-
ingly tech-driven business environment.

虽然到 2023 年，预算限制将影响小型和大型组织，但必须认识到培训和认证的价值，以确保技术人员具备在日益技术驱动的商业环境中取得成功所需的技能。

### Training and certification are important in an increased or reduced hiring environment
### 培训和认证在无论扩招或缩招的环境都具有重要性
Training is crucial for increased or reduced hiring activity. The data also suggests that job cuts are to blame for revenue 
misses and economic caution, highlighting the importance of taking a strategic approach to hiring and staffing decisions. 
Organizations need to be aware of the types of staff most affected by staffing cuts, such as senior staff members, and be 
strategic in their hiring efforts by targeting roles such as developers and IT management that are commonly recruited for.

培训对于扩招或缩招至关重要。 数据还表明，裁员是收入下降和经济谨慎的罪魁祸首，凸显了采取战略方法进行招聘和人员配置决策的重要性。 组织需要了解受裁员影响最大的员工类型（例如高级员工），并通过针对常见招聘职位（例如开发人员和 IT 管理人员）进行战略性招聘工作。

Organizations that are reducing staff or pausing hiring plans need to focus on upskilling their existing workforce to 
prevent negative outcomes such as increased workloads and longer time frames for product delivery.

正在裁员或暂停招聘计划的组织需要专注于提高现有员工的技能，以防止出现负面结果，例如工作量增加和产品交付时间延长等。
