## Support channels
## 支持渠道

 Good user support is essential to maintaining an open source project on GitHub. Below, we provide recommended practices for open source projects to provide better support for their community:

良好的用户支持对于在GitHub上维护开源项目至关重要。接下来，我们为开源项目提供一些推荐的做法，以便为其社区提供更好的支持：

1. Create a [SUPPORT.md](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-support-resources-to-your-project) file that details how people can get help with your project(s).

  创建一个[SUPPORT.md](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-support-resources-to-your-project) 文件，提示用户如何为你的开源项目提供支持。

2. Create detailed and well-organized documentation: This can include instructions on installing and using the project, trou- bleshooting tips, and examples of everyday use cases.

创建详细的、思路清晰的文档，包括：项目安装文档、使用文档、故障排除技巧，以及日常使用的示例。

3. Use the issue tracker: This allows users to report bugs, request features, and ask for help. Responding promptly and providing precise and detailed responses can help to build trust and credibility with users.

 使用问题跟踪器：它允许用户报告错误、请求新功能，并寻求帮助。及时响应，并提供准确详细的回复，有助于建立用户的信任和可信度。

4. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Encourage users to provide feedback, and actively seek feedback through surveys or interviews; this can help you understand what users want and how to improve your project.

 乐于接受反馈和建议：鼓励用户提供反馈，并通过调查或问卷等方式积极地寻求反馈；这可以帮助你了解用户的需求，以及如何改进你的项目。

5. Communicate actively and transparently: Using a blog, news- letter, or social media to share progress, road maps, and updates about your project can help users to know what\'s happening and how to plan for future changes.

积极沟通，使项目透明化：可以使用博客、新闻发布或社交媒体等，来分享项目的进展、路线图和更新等，帮助用户了解项目的当前进展，以及未来的计划和规划。

6. Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions) to support and engage with your users and developers. Projects use GitHub Discussions. It can help build a community around the project and provide an easy way for users to get help and connect with other users.

使用[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions)链接项目的用户和开发人员，并与之互动。使用GitHub讨论，可以帮助你围绕项目建立一个社区，并提供了一种简单的方式，方便用户获得帮助，并与其他用户沟通。

7. Set up an easy-to-find and access help center: a centralized location where users can find answers to common questions, submit support tickets, and contact the core developers.

建立帮助中心，且要易于查找、易于访问：放在一个集中的位置，方便用户找到常见问题的答案，并提交支持票以及联系核心的开发人员。

8. [Archive inactive repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) so that the users and developers know the repos are no longer receiving support.

设置一个[Archive inactive repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories)，对不活跃的代码进行归档，这样用户及开发者就知道这些代码库已经不再提供帮助。

9. Consider adding a [FUNDING.md](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository) file to let users know how they can support your project.

考虑添加一个 [FUNDING.md](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository)筹集资金的文档，让用户知道如何帮助你的项目；

 By following these practices, open source projects hosted on GitHub can provide better support, resulting in a more successful and sustainable project.
 
 通过遵循这些实践，可以使得托管在GitHub上的开源项目得到更好的支持，从而使项目更加成功和可持续。

## Security
## 安全

 Implementing security measures for GitHub organizations is vital to protect the code and data of the organization\'s projects. Below, we provide a few recommendations focused on security measures for GitHub organizations:
 
 对GitHub施加一些安全措施，对于保护组织项目的代码和数据至关重要。下面，我们提供了一些针对GitHub组织的安全措施的建议：

1. Two-factor authentication (2FA): [Enabling 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) for all organiza- tion members helps add an extra security layer to the organi- zation\'s accounts.

对所有组织成员进行双因子身份验证（2FA）[Enabling 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa)，给组织的帐户添加额外的安全层。

2. Access control: Use GitHub\'s built-in access control features, such as roles and teams, to limit who has access to the orga- nization\'s repositories and what actions they can perform.

访问控制：使用GitHub内置的访问控制功能（例如角色和团队），来限制有权访问组织代码库的人员，并限制他们可以执行的操作。

3. Use [GitHub Branch Protection Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) and CODEOWNERS files to ensure that every change to your repos has been reviewed by the right people.

使用[GitHub Branch Protection Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches)（Github分支保护规则）和CODEOWNERS（代码所有者）文件来确保对代码库的每一个更改都经过了合适的人的审查。

4. Secure code reviews: Implement a code review process that includes security checks, such as static code analysis, to iden- tify and fix any potential vulnerabilities in the code.

5. Continuous integration & deployment (CI / CD): Use CI / CD tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code, allowing for faster identifi- cation and
    fixing of security issues.

6. Use [GitHub Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) to find vulnerabilities in your code.

7. Use dependency security scanning tools: Run tools like GitHub\'s Dependabot, Snyk, etc. to find vulnerabilities in packages, libraries, and other third-party code you depend on.

8. Employee security training: Enroll in security practices training provided by your organization.

9. Achieve and maintain the [ OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)

 for the open source project. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge recognizes and encourages open source projects that follow best security and vulnerability management practices. Projects that earn the badge will have demonstrated that they have a security policy, a vulnerability reporting process, and a method for handling reported vulnerabilities. By having the badge, projects indicate that they take security seriously and that users and contributors can trust that the project addresses vulnerabilities responsibly.

10. Identify who on the project will handle security issues (could be a team). Create a SECURITY.md file, and set up an email account to receive security vulnerability alerts.

11. Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories) to track, manage, and publish responses to vulnerabilities found in your project.

12. Use GPG to [sign commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) locally so you can mark them as verified on GitHub. Other people can be confident that the changes come from a trusted source.

13. The [OpenSSF scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) helps maintainers improve their security best practices, and open source consumers judge whether the software dependencies are safe. Scorecard assesses several heuristics associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0 to 10. You can use these scores to understand specific areas to strengthen the secu- rity posture of the project.

 By implementing these practices, organizations and individuals can help protect their code and data and keep their projects on GitHub safe and secure. Security is an ongoing process, and there is a need to continuously update and reinforce security measures.
