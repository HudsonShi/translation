## Support channels

 Good user support is essential to maintaining an open source project
 on GitHub. Below, we provide recommended practices for open source
 projects to provide better support for their community:

1. Create a [SUPPORT.md](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-support-resources-to-your-project) file that details how people can get help with your project(s).

2. Create detailed and well-organized documentation: This can include instructions on installing and using the project, trou- bleshooting tips, and examples of everyday use cases.

3. Use the issue tracker: This allows users to report bugs, request features, and ask for help. Responding promptly and providing precise and detailed responses can help to build trust and credibility with users.

4. Be open to feedback and suggestions: Encourage users to provide feedback, and actively seek feedback through surveys or interviews; this can help you understand what users want and how to improve your project.

5. Communicate actively and transparently: Using a blog, news- letter, or social media to share progress, road maps, and updates about your project can help users to know what\'s happening and how to plan for future changes.

6. Use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions) to support and engage with your users and developers. Projects use GitHub Discussions. It can help build a community around the project and provide an easy way for users to get help and connect with other users.

7. Set up an easy-to-find and access help center: a centralized location where users can find answers to common questions, submit support tickets, and contact the core developers.

8. [Archive inactive repos](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) so that the users and developers know the repos are no longer receiving support.

9. Consider adding a [FUNDING.md](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/displaying-a-sponsor-button-in-your-repository) file to let users know how they can support your project.

 By following these practices, open source projects hosted on GitHub can provide better support, resulting in a more successful and sustainable project.

## Security

 Implementing security measures for GitHub organizations is vital to protect the code and data of the organization\'s projects. Below, we provide a few recommendations focused on security measures for GitHub
 organizations:

1. Two-factor authentication (2FA): [Enabling 2FA](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa) for all organiza- tion members helps add an extra security layer to the organi- zation\'s accounts.

2. Access control: Use GitHub\'s built-in access control features, such as roles and teams, to limit who has access to the orga- nization\'s repositories and what actions they can perform.

3. Use [GitHub Branch Protection Rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches) and CODEOWNERS files to ensure that every change to your repos has been reviewed by the right people.

4. Secure code reviews: Implement a code review process that includes security checks, such as static code analysis, to iden- tify and fix any potential vulnerabilities in the code.

5. Continuous integration & deployment (CI / CD): Use CI / CD tools like GitHub Actions or CircleCI to automate the building, testing, and deployment of code, allowing for faster identifi- cation and
    fixing of security issues.

6. Use [GitHub Code Scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning) to find vulnerabilities in your code.

7. Use dependency security scanning tools: Run tools like GitHub\'s Dependabot, Snyk, etc. to find vulnerabilities in packages, libraries, and other third-party code you depend on.

8. Employee security training: Enroll in security practices training provided by your organization.

9. Achieve and maintain the [ OpenSSF Best Practices Badge](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/en)

 for the open source project. The OpenSSF Best Practices Badge recognizes and encourages open source projects that follow best security and vulnerability management practices. Projects that earn the badge will have demonstrated that they have a security policy, a vulnerability reporting process, and a method for handling reported vulnerabilities. By having the badge, projects indicate that they take security seriously and that users and contributors can trust that the project addresses vulnerabilities responsibly.

10. Identify who on the project will handle security issues (could be a team). Create a SECURITY.md file, and set up an email account to receive security vulnerability alerts.

11. Use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories) to track, manage, and publish responses to vulnerabilities found in your project.

12. Use GPG to [sign commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification) locally so you can mark them as verified on GitHub. Other people can be confident that the changes come from a trusted source.

13. The [OpenSSF scorecard](https://securityscorecards.dev/) helps maintainers improve their security best practices, and open source consumers judge whether the software dependencies are safe. Scorecard assesses several heuristics associated with software security and assigns each check a score of 0 to 10. You can use these scores to understand specific areas to strengthen the secu- rity posture of the project.

 By implementing these practices, organizations and individuals can help protect their code and data and keep their projects on GitHub safe and secure. Security is an ongoing process, and there is a need to continuously update and reinforce security measures.
