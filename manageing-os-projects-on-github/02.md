## Introduction

 The availability of OSS is changing how organizations develop and deliver products. A transparent development community and access to public source code enable organizations to think differ- ently about procuring, implementing, testing, deploying, and main- taining software (**FIGURE 1**).

 OSS has created an ecosystem with many benefits for all involved. Organizations across industries are building and growing their open source operations under an OSPO to help use and contribute to open source projects more efficiently and effectively and to benefit from its strategic impact (**FIGURE 2**).

OSS allows shared development and lowers research and development costs by enabling organizations to reap the benefit of billions of dollars of OSS, which they can harness to create better products and services. In addition, it helps to accelerate

 **STRATEGIC IMPACT OF OSS**

#####  Accelerate the development of open solutions

#####  Provide an implementation to an open standard

#####  Commoditize a market

#####  Reduce prices of nonstrategic software assets

#####  Share development costs

#####  Drive demand by building an ecosystem for products and services

#####  Partner with others

#####  Engage customers

#####  Strengthen relationships with common goals

 product development and enables a faster time to market by aligning business needs with upstream open source projects. Organizations do not get involved in open source projects because it is fun; they do it because it is a part of their business or product strategy.

 Where does most open source development happen? **GitHub**. GitHub is a crucial platform for open source development. It is a web-based hosting service that uses the Git version control system to allow developers to collaborate and share their code.

 It provides a centralized platform for open source developers to store, manage, and track changes to their codebase and collaborate on development efforts with other contributors.

 One of the critical advantages of GitHub is that it allows developers to easily share their code with others, making it simple for others to contribute, review, and merge changes. It is a powerful tool for open source development, as it enables developers to work together on large-scale projects, regardless of their physical location. GitHub also provides a platform for community building and collaboration by allowing users to create open source projects, create and manage issues, and communicate with other developers via pull requests (PRs) and comments.

 Additionally, GitHub provides a wide range of tools and features tailored to open source developers\' needs. It includes features such as project management tools, code review functionality, packaging, release, deployment capabilities, and built-in integration with other developer tools such as continuous integration services, making it an all-in-one platform for open source development.

 This paper will discuss recommended practices to help you improve your GitHub presence to attract more users and developers to your projects.
