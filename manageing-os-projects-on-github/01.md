## Foreword

While open source principles are relatively straightforward, "getting it right" can be challenging. Open source sits at the intersection of technology, community, business, and personal identity, so it stands to reason that some amount of tooling and rigor---best practices---will help smooth the path to success.

 In my time as the Director of the Microsoft Open Source Programs Office (OSPO), the company evolved from having a few hundred developers and repos on GitHub to having tens of thousands of each. We moved from *ad hoc* operations to formal but still manual processes to near-full automation of our presence on GitHub and from project communities of dozens to thousands. We developed a ton of tools and best practices to smooth that path.

 My move to work at GitHub nearly five years ago was meant to bring some of those tools and learnings to the GitHub product and, ultimately, you, the open source developers of the world. Today, GitHub has many facilities and possibilities, from discussions to actions / checks, packages, and releases, to security, that help you and your project. I can't even list them all.

 Successful open source is as much about people and communities as it is about the code. With this article, Ibrahim applies his long history in open source to create a jumping-off point for you to make the most of your open source efforts on GitHub. Using the best practices outlined here will help you create a secure, robust, and vibrant community around your project. GitHub supplies much of the infrastructure, and you provide the innovation and community.

 See you in a repo.

## Abstract

 Open source software (OSS) has transformed our world and become the backbone of our digital economy and the foundation of our digital world. Today, OSS powers the digital economy and enables scientific and technological breakthroughs that improve our lives. From the Internet and the mobile apps we use daily to the operating systems and programming languages we use to build the future, OSS has played a vital role. It is the lifeblood of the technology industry.

 The use of GitHub for open source development has become increasingly popular in recent years, providing a platform for collaboration and sharing code.

 Managing an open source project on GitHub can become less challenging with proper guidelines. This paper provides an overview of best practices for using GitHub for open source development. By following
 these practices, open source developers can improve the organization, understandability, and collaboration of their projects on GitHub, making it easier for other developers to adopt and contribute.
