## Language

 At the Linux Foundation, we work with open source projects from around the globe. Some projects come to the Linux Foundation for hosting from countries where English is not the official language. Much of the project's documentation on GitHub is sometimes not provided in English. Our recommendation has always been to use the English language for any content published on GitHub targeted at a global audience. It is the most common language in software development and open source communities. When a project makes available documentation in English, it can be easily under- stood and utilized by a much larger audience.

### Adopt core open source principles

 Open source development is a collaborative approach to software development in which the source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. A defining characteristic of the development process is openness throughout the entire life cycle, from design to release. All aspects of the development process, including design, planning, implementation, testing, and release, are transparent and open to contributions from the wider community. This allows for a collaborative approach to software development, where individuals and organizations can share their expertise, knowledge, and resources to create high-quality software that meets the needs of a diverse set of users.

 Core concepts of open source development that enable the collab- orative aspect at scale include peer review, release early and release often, and continuous testing and integration.

- Peer review is having other developers review and critique the code, which helps improve the quality of the software.

- Release early and release often is a strategy for making software available to users as soon as possible, with frequent updates and improvements.

- Continuous testing and integration is constantly testing and integrating new code changes, which helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.

 These concepts work together to create a collaborative, trans- parent, and efficient approach to software development. In the next subsections, we will explore how GitHub supports these core open source development concepts via various features that enable large-scale implementation of these concepts.

#### Peer review

 The peer review practice reduces variations in style, prompts valuable conversations, and preserves the project's quality standards. GitHub manages it through the PR feature. A PR is a way for developers to submit changes they have made to a project\'s code for review by other collaborators. With the creation of a PR, other collaborators can review the code changes, leave comments, and approve or request changes before there is a merger of the code into the proj- ect\'s main branch. To ensure peer review, it is recommended that the owner of the GitHub org adjusts the settings and enables the [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging)

#### Release early and often

 \"Release early and often\" is an OSS development philosophy that advocates for frequent and incremental releases of a project.

 GitHub supports this development approach in open source projects through [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and [releases](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28).

 []{#_bookmark9 .anchor}By using a development branch for ongoing work and a separate release branch for stable, production-ready code, developers work on new features and bug fixes in the development branch and periodically merge the changes into the release branch.

 Another way is using feature branches, where developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix they are working on. Once the work on a feature branch is complete, its merger into the development branch and eventually into the release branch can take place.

 Additionally, GitHub has a feature called releases, which allows packaging, tagging, and the distribution of software versions. This feature can mark specific versions of the code as a release and provide a way for users to download and use the release version. Users can also view the release notes and see the changes made in each release.

#### Continuous testing and integration

 Continuous testing and integration in GitHub are managed through a combination of tools, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and other CI / CD tools.

 GitHub Actions is a feature that allows developers to automate their build and test workflow by creating custom actions triggered by specific events, such as a push to a branch or a PR. With GitHub Actions, developers can set up automated tests and integration steps that run whenever specific events occur. For example, with the creation of a PR, developers can set up GitHub Actions and [Status Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) to run a suite of tests on the code changes to ensure that they work as expected before merging into the main branch.

 Another way to manage continuous testing and integration is by using third-party CI / CD tools such as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), etc. These tools integrate with GitHub and allow developers to set up a pipeline of tests and integration steps that run automat- ically whenever there are code changes pushed to a repository.

 For example, when there are code changes pushed to the develop- ment branch, the CI / CD tool can automatically run tests, build and deploy the code to a staging environment, and then run additional tests to ensure that everything is working as expected before deploying to production.

 Additionally, many third-party tools offer various testing options, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, which allows for testing different aspects of the application. The design of both GitHub Actions and third-party CI / CD tools makes the continuous testing and integration process as seamless and efficient as possible.

## Conclusion

 GitHub plays an essential role in open source development by providing a centralized platform for code collaboration, community building, and project management, making it easy for developers to collaborate on open source projects and bring them to fruition. It is a vital tool that allows developers to share, collaborate, and improve their contribution to the open source ecosystem.

 As for getting started, there are several steps individuals can follow to bootstrap their open source development activities on GitHub:

1. Start by finding a project that interests you. Look for proj- ects with a transparent development process and an OSI-approved license.

2. Read the project\'s documentation and guidelines. Make sure you understand the project\'s goals and its organization.

3. Create a project fork on GitHub to have a copy of the project to which you can work and submit changes.

4. Make small changes, and submit them as PRs to the upstream project. This process will allow the project maintainers to review your work and provide feedback.

5. Be open to feedback and willing to make changes. Open source development is collaborative, and good communica- tion is critical.

6. Contribute to the project\'s community by answering ques- tions, providing support, and helping new contributors.

7. Look for mentorship opportunities; if you find a maintainer whose work you admire, reach out to them, and ask if they would be willing to mentor you.

8. Keep your fork up to date with the main project by regularly syncing your fork with the original repository.

 We hope you find this paper helpful in providing an overview of best practices for using GitHub for open source development. If you're looking to start working with open source development, head to GitHub, set up an account, and begin!
