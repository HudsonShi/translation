## Language

##  语言

 At the Linux Foundation, we work with open source projects from around the globe. Some projects come to the Linux Foundation for hosting from countries where English is not the official language. Much of the project's documentation on GitHub is sometimes not provided in English. Our recommendation has always been to use the English language for any content published on GitHub targeted at a global audience. It is the most common language in software development and open source communities. When a project makes available documentation in English, it can be easily under- stood and utilized by a much larger audience.
 
  Linux 基金会与来自全球各地的开放源码项目都有合作。Linux 基金会托管的一些项目的所属国家并不以英语为官方语言。GitHub 上的许多项目文档也没有英文版。我们一直建议在 GitHub 上发布的面向全球受众的内容都使用英语。英语是软件开发和开源社区中最常见的语言。一个项目提供英文版文档，它可以被更多的受众轻松理解和使用。

### Adopt core open source principles

### 采用核心开源原则

 Open source development is a collaborative approach to software development in which the source code is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. A defining characteristic of the development process is openness throughout the entire life cycle, from design to release. All aspects of the development process, including design, planning, implementation, testing, and release, are transparent and open to contributions from the wider community. This allows for a collaborative approach to software development, where individuals and organizations can share their expertise, knowledge, and resources to create high-quality software that meets the needs of a diverse set of users.
 
 开源开发是一种协作性的软件开发方式，源代码可以轻松地被所有人使用、修改和发布。开发过程的一个显著特征就是开放性贯穿从设计到发布的整个生命周期。开发过程中的设计、规划、实施、测试和发布等等所有方面都是透明的，并接受广大社区的贡献。这些特征使得软件开发可以以协作的方式进行，个人和组织可以分享他们的专长、知识和资源，以能满足不同用户的需求创造高质量的软件。

 Core concepts of open source development that enable the collab- orative aspect at scale include peer review, release early and release often, and continuous testing and integration.
 
 能促成规模化的协作的开源开发的核心概念包括同侪审查、早发布并常发布、持续测试和集成等。

- Peer review is having other developers review and critique the code, which helps improve the quality of the software.

- 同侪审查是指让其他开发者对代码进行审查和评论，这有助于提高软件的质量。

- Release early and release often is a strategy for making software available to users as soon as possible, with frequent updates and improvements.

- 早发布并常发布是一种使软件尽早面世的策略，软件上线后进行频繁的更新和改进。

- Continuous testing and integration is constantly testing and integrating new code changes, which helps to identify and fix bugs early in the development process.

- 持续测试和集成是不断测试和集成新提交的代码，这有助于在开发过程中及早发现和修复错误。

 These concepts work together to create a collaborative, trans- parent, and efficient approach to software development. In the next subsections, we will explore how GitHub supports these core open source development concepts via various features that enable large-scale implementation of these concepts.
 
 这些概念构成了一种协作的、透明的、高效的软件开发方法。在接下来的小节中，我们将探讨 GitHub 如何通过各种功能来阐释这些核心的开源开发理念的，而这些功能就是这些理念的大规模工程实践。

#### 同侪审查

 The peer review practice reduces variations in style, prompts valuable conversations, and preserves the project's quality standards. GitHub manages it through the PR feature. A PR is a way for developers to submit changes they have made to a project\'s code for review by other collaborators. With the creation of a PR, other collaborators can review the code changes, leave comments, and approve or request changes before there is a merger of the code into the proj- ect\'s main branch. To ensure peer review, it is recommended that the owner of the GitHub org adjusts the settings and enables the [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging)
 
 同侪审查减少了风格上的差异，引发了有价值的对话，并保持了项目的质量标准。GitHub 通过 PR 功能对其进行管理。PR 是一种让开发者提交他们对项目代码所做的修改，供其他合作者审查的方式。通过创建 PR，其他合作者可以审查变更的代码，进行评论，并在代码合并到项目的主分支之前批准或要求修改。为了确保有同侪审查的流程，建议 GitHub 组织的所有者修改设置，开启[分支](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging)。

 [protection rules](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/defining-the-mergeability-of-pull-requests/about-protected-branches#require-pull-request-reviews-before-merging) (either for the org or specific report) to require a PR.

#### Release early and often

#### 早发布并常发布

 \"Release early and often\" is an OSS development philosophy that advocates for frequent and incremental releases of a project.
 
 ”早发布并常发布“是一种开源软件的开发理念，主张项目的频繁和渐进式发布。

 GitHub supports this development approach in open source projects through [branches](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) and [releases](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28).
 
  GitHub 通过[分支](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)和[发布](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/releases?apiVersion=2022-11-28)支持开源项目的这种开发方式。

 []{#_bookmark9 .anchor}By using a development branch for ongoing work and a separate release branch for stable, production-ready code, developers work on new features and bug fixes in the development branch and periodically merge the changes into the release branch.
 
 通过使用一个开发分支来处理正在进行的工作，一个单独的发布分支来处理稳定的、可用于生产的代码，开发人员在开发分支中处理新的功能和错误修复，并定期将这些变更合并到发布分支中。

 Another way is using feature branches, where developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix they are working on. Once the work on a feature branch is complete, its merger into the development branch and eventually into the release branch can take place.
 
 另一种方法是使用特性分支，即开发人员为他们正在开发的每个特性或错误修复创建一个新的分支。当某个特性分支的工作完成后，就可以将其合并到开发分支，并最终合并到发布分支。

 Additionally, GitHub has a feature called releases, which allows packaging, tagging, and the distribution of software versions. This feature can mark specific versions of the code as a release and provide a way for users to download and use the release version. Users can also view the release notes and see the changes made in each release.
 
 此外，GitHub 还有一个叫做发布的功能，可以对软件版本进行打包、标记和发布。这个功能可以将特定版本的代码标记为发布版本，并为用户提供下载和使用发布版本的途径。用户还可以查看发布说明，并查看每个版本的变更。

#### Continuous testing and integration

#### 持续测试和集成

 Continuous testing and integration in GitHub are managed through a combination of tools, such as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) and other CI / CD tools.
 
 GitHub 的持续测试和集成是通过一系列工具来管理的，比如 [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) 和其他 CI / CD 工具。

 GitHub Actions is a feature that allows developers to automate their build and test workflow by creating custom actions triggered by specific events, such as a push to a branch or a PR. With GitHub Actions, developers can set up automated tests and integration steps that run whenever specific events occur. For example, with the creation of a PR, developers can set up GitHub Actions and [Status Checks](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks) to run a suite of tests on the code changes to ensure that they work as expected before merging into the main branch.
 
 开发者可以通过 GitHub Actions 来创建由特定事件（如推送到分支或 PR）触发的自定义动作来实现构建和测试工作流程的自动化。设置好 GitHub Actions 后，开发者可以随时通过事件触发自动化流程。例如，创建 PR 后，开发者可以设置 GitHub Actions和[状态检测](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/collaborating-on-repositories-with-code-quality-features/about-status-checks)，对代码变更运行一套测试，以确保它们在合并到主分支之前符合预期。

 Another way to manage continuous testing and integration is by using third-party CI / CD tools such as [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/), [TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/), [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/), etc. These tools integrate with GitHub and allow developers to set up a pipeline of tests and integration steps that run automat- ically whenever there are code changes pushed to a repository.
 
 另一种管理持续测试和集成的方法是使用第三方 CI/CD 工具，如 [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/)、[TravisCI](https://www.travis-ci.com/)、[Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)等。借助于 GitHub 与这些工具的集成，开发人员可以设置测试和集成步骤的工作流，当有代码被推送到仓库时就自动运行。

 For example, when there are code changes pushed to the develop- ment branch, the CI / CD tool can automatically run tests, build and deploy the code to a staging environment, and then run additional tests to ensure that everything is working as expected before deploying to production.
 
 例如，当有代码被推送到开发分支时，CI/CD 工具可以自动运行测试、构建并部署代码到预发布环境，然后运行其他的测试，以确保在部署到生产之前一切都符合预期。

 Additionally, many third-party tools offer various testing options, such as unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing, which allows for testing different aspects of the application. The design of both GitHub Actions and third-party CI / CD tools makes the continuous testing and integration process as seamless and efficient as possible.
 
 此外，许多第三方工具提供了各种测试选项，如单元测试、集成测试和端到端测试，从而可以测试应用程序的不同方面。GitHub Actions 和第三方 CI/CD 工具的设计使持续测试和集成过程变得尽可能地无缝和高效。
