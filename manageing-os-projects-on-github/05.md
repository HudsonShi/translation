## Licensing

### General licensing recommendations

 The license of an open source project determines the rights to use, copy, modify, and distribute the code. The choice of license is essential in determining the project\'s openness. Open source projects are recommended only to use licenses approved by the Open Source Initiative and recognized as "free / libre" by the Free

 Software Foundation. Such licenses allow the software to be freely used, modified, and shared. To be approved by the Open Source Initiative, a license must go through its license review process to confirm that it satisfies its Open Source Definition (OSD). You may come across many other licenses that are incompatible with the OSD. Most of these licenses are "Source Available" licenses that commonly include restrictions or limitations on software use and distribution. These restrictions often render the licenses incom- patible with the OSD.

 Below is a list of recommended practices that open source projects can adopt to help provide accurate licensing information:

1. Include a LICENSE.md file in a conventional location (e.g., at the root of the repository): The file should specify the terms and conditions for using, distributing, and modifying the software.

2. Use [OSI-approved open source licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical): These licenses have been widely reviewed and used, which makes them more accessible for developers to understand and comply with. In addition, GitHub has a convenient "choose a license" facility that makes it easy to use the most common OSI-approved licenses when creating your repos.

3. Include the license information in your REAMDE.md file: Include a note in the REAMDE.md file that specifies the project\'s license and provides a link to the LICENSE.md file.

4. Mark any third-party code: If the project contains third-party code, clearly mark it, and include information on the license of the third-party code.

5. Use a license badge in your README.md file: Users can quickly see what licenses your project uses by including a license badge in your README.md file.

6. Include a [Software Package Data Exchange](https://spdx.dev/) (SPDX) short-form identifier in a comment at the top headers of each source code file. SPDX is a standard format for communicating the components, licenses, and copyrights associated with soft- ware packages. Open source projects use SPDX to make the license and copyright information more accessible and machine-readable.

7. Ensure GitHub recognizes your license: Your chosen license should appear in the GitHub UI repo summary section. If it does not, it means GitHub could not find or understand your license. Unfortunately, that likely means others cannot as well.

8. Regularly review and update the licensing information to keep it current and accurate.

9. Provide clear guidelines for contributing to the project from a licensing perspective, especially if your project uses a DCO or a CLA (more on that in the next section).
 
 By following these best practices, open source projects on GitHub can provide accurate licensing information and help developers comply with legal requirements, making it easier for developers to understand and use the software. These practices also help to avoid any legal or compliance issues.

### DCOs and CLAs

 DCO and CLA are two concepts used in the open source devel- opment on GitHub.

 DCO stands for Developer Certificate of Origin, and it is a way for developers to certify that their contributions to a project are their original work or that they have the necessary rights to submit the code. It happens by adding a \"Signed-off-by\" line to the end of each commit message, which indicates that the developer agrees to the DCO and that they are the original author of the code or have the right to submit it. For instance, the Linux kernel develop- ment process requires all contributors to sign off their code, which indicates the contributor certifies the code as outlined in the [DCO](https://developercertificate.org/).

 The signature communicates that the contributor has created or received the contribution under an appropriate open source license that allows you to incorporate it into the project's code base under
 the license indicated in the file. The DCO establishes a chain of people responsible for the licensing and provenance of contributions to the project.

 A Contributor License Agreement (CLA) is a legal agreement between a developer or their employer and the project owner or maintainer. A CLA outlines the terms and conditions for contrib- uting code to the project, such as the rights and responsibilities of both parties. Open source projects use CLAs to protect them- selves from legal issues that may arise from contributions made by third parties or when a company or organization is developing a project, and there is a solicitation of contributions from outside contributors.

### Recommendations

1. Include a copy of or reference to the DCO in your CONTRIBUTING.md file.

2. Set up a bot to enforce a "Signed-off-by:" tag in each commit. For example, you can install the [GitHub DCO app](https://github.com/apps/dco) to manage this aspect.

3. For projects hosted in the Linux Foundation or any umbrella foundations, use The Linux Foundation EasyCLA tool ([https://lfcla.com/](https://lfcla.com/)) to enforce signed CLAs before accepting contributions.

4. For projects hosted and managed by their founders, consider using [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/). The recommendation is that employees consult with their corporate counsel on the most appropriate ways to handle CLAs.
