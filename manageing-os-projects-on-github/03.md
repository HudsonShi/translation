## Documentation

 Clear and detailed documentation is crucial for open source projects hosted on GitHub. It helps to ensure that the project is easy to understand and use for other developers, which can increase the number of contributors and users. Good documentation should include an overview of the project\'s purpose, usage instructions, and any dependencies or requirements. It should also include detailed explanations of the code, its workings, and any known issues or limitations. Having clear documentation can make it easier for other developers to understand the project and make contributions. It can also make it easier to maintain the project over time, as developers will better understand how the code works and can confidently make changes. Additionally, good documentation makes it easier for users to know how to use the software and troubleshoot any issues they may encounter.

 An open source project can provide different types of documentation to help users and developers of its community. Historically, documentation has been an area that requires improvements. However, the situation is improving, with many projects having excellent documentation covering all areas of the projects.

 In the following subsections, we highlight three core areas where documentation is essential.

1. Project

    b.  Mission

    c.  Governance

    d.  Community structure

    e.  Release cadence

    f.  Road map and priorities

    g.  Use cases

    h.  FAQs

2. Documentation targeted for users

a.  User guide and tutorials

b.  API guide

c.  Architecture overview

d.  Installation guide

e.  Feature request and security vulnerability reporting process

f.  Experience sharing section


3. Documentation targeted for developers


a.  Detailed architecture and mapping to code sub-systems services when
    applicable

b.  Development process

c.  Getting involved

d.  Guidelines for participation

e.  Feature request process

f.  Patch submission process

g.  Signed-off-by process, when applicable

h.  Developer guides and tutorials

i.  API guide

### Recommendations

1. Use the [REPOLINTER](https://github.com/todogroup/repolinter)
    tool, created by the [TODO Group](https://todogroup.org/)^1, to identify common issues in GitHub repos.

2. Add a README.md file welcoming new community members to the project and explaining why the project is worthwhile and how to begin.

3. []{#_bookmark4 .anchor}Add a [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors) file explaining how to contribute to the project. The file explains the types of contributions required and how the process works.

4. Add a [CODEOWNERS](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners) file to define individuals or teams respon- sible for code in a repository.

5. Add a [CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-code-of-conduct-to-your-project) file that sets the ground rules for participants' behavior and helps facilitate a friendly, welcoming environment. The CODE \_ OF \_ CONDUCT.md file signals that this is a welcoming project to contribute to and defines standards for engaging with the project's community.

6. Add a [SECURITY.md](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) file that tells users how to report secu- rity issues in the project.

7. Provide documentation on the release methodology, cadence, criteria, etc.

8. Document your project governance, and make it available on the project's repo.

 GitHub provides the ability, at the organization level, to automatically apply such community health files to any repo created within the org.
