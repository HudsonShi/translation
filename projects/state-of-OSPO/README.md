# The 2023 State of OSPOs and OSS Initiatives

Earlier this year, the TODO Group partnered with Linux Foundation Research to run its sixth annual state of the OSPO survey. Survey data was collected from participants in a wide variety of job roles, companies, industries, and geographies, with the goal of capturing a global view of OSPOs.

Overall, the research found that as OSS use and contributions are becoming more mainstream, the role of OSPOs and OSS initiatives are better understood. This translates to greater support for innovation, compliance, and security, growth in OSPO adoption, and increased project sustainability. However, there are important financial and cultural concerns that may hinder growth.
