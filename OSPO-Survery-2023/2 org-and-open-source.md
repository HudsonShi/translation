**Tell us a bit about your organization and open source
An Open Source Program Office (OSPO) is a center of expertise, either virtual or physical, whose people support, nurture, share, explain, and promote the growth of open source within an organization.

The way the people behind an OSPO achieve this is by creating and maintaining a framework covering the following aspects: strategy, governance, compliance, and community engagement. The OSPO's strategy focuses on aligning the organization's open source goals with its overall organization objectives.

An OSPO serves as a vital bridge between an organization and the open source community, helping to ensure that the organization is a good steward of open source and can reap the benefits of open source adoption while minimizing risks.**
