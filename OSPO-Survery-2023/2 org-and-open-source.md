## Tell us a bit about your organization and open source
An open source program oﬀice (OSPO) or similar open source initiative is designed to be the center of competency for an organization's open source operations and structure. This can include setting code use, distribution, selection, auditing and other policies, as well as training developers, ensuring legal compliance and promoting and building community engagement that beneﬁts the organization strategically.
