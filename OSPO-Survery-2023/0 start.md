# 2023 Open Source Program Office (OSPO) Survey

The TODO Group, together with Linux Foundation Research, Partner 1, is conducting a survey as part of a research project on the prevalence and outcomes of open source programs and similar open source initiatives operating across the globe.

*This survey should take no more than 15 minutes of your time.*

As a thank you for participating in this research, once you have completed the survey, a code will be displayed on the confirmation page which can be used for a 25% discount on any Linux Foundation training course or certification exam listed in our [catalog](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog/).

Your responses are anonymous and will be used to compile a report to be released later this year. Only one response per organization will be included in the study results if you choose to provide that information. 

Your name and/or organization name will not be displayed. Reviews are attributed to your role, organization size, and industry. Responses will be subject to the Linux Foundation’s Privacy Policy, available at [https://linuxfoundation.org/privacy](https://linuxfoundation.org/privacy). Please note that research partners who are not Linux Foundation employees will review the survey results. Survey partners are not permitted to use your data for other purposes.
