Introduction
============

Over two decades, the open source community has grown immensely. In
2000, there were a handful of high-profile open source projects and a
small number of companies and organiza- tions to help steer the
community's evolution. Today, the global open source ecosystem
consists of millions of projects and an equally large and regionally
diverse constellation of participants.

Nothing underlines the open source community's growth and global reach
like GitHub. In 2010, the social coding platform hosted roughly
100,000 users and 1 million code repositories.2 As of October 2022,
GitHub hosts 83 million developers, 4 million organizations, and over
200 million open source code reposi- tories.3 Some 74% of its global
user base resides outside of the

United States, with a significant increase in the share of developers
based in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, several
breakthrough OSS innovations have come from places such as Japan
(Ruby), Finland (Linux), and South Africa (Ubuntu).

Growing global participation in OSS is a testament to the ecosys-
tem's success. However, the proliferation of open source projects and
organizations also raises a vital question: Is fragmentation in the
open source community impeding its progress?

On the surface, the open source community's recent track record would
suggest otherwise. After all, two-plus decades of open col- laboration
have resulted in a potent array of reusable software components and
fostered unrivaled innovation and creativity in the digital economy.
One recent estimate (and most others) suggests that 70% to 90% of most
modern application stacks consist of OSS, from operating systems to
cryptography and networking functions to the enterprise applications
running mission-critical operations for global corporations.4

On the flip side, open source ecosystem leaders are raising legitimate
questions and concerns about whether fragmentation in the com- munity
could undermine several essential functions vital to a sustainable and
thriving ecosystem. For example, consider the fol- lowing three
domains:

Innovation and collaboration
----------------------------

The freedom to see, modify, and distribute code has always been the
open source community's central tenet, along with the commu- nity's
decentralized production model, which frequently results in hundreds
and sometimes thousands of independent contributors collaborating to
build and refine open source code libraries. Even the most ardent of
competitors often work together to address shared challenges, thereby
avoiding the duplication of effort while moving faster to develop and
adopt emerging standards and innovations.

The potency of the open source model notwithstanding, the stag- gering
existence of 200-million-plus projects on GitHub has stirred a debate.
Some open source leaders say the continued proliferation of new
projects and coordinating bodies creates healthy compe- tition between
rival approaches, and competition drives innova- tion. Other
participants argue that the explosion of projects signals an abundance
of duplication and risks a diffusion of the commu- nity's resources.
To what extent could increasing fragmentation in software development
efforts create inefficiencies and clutter in the marketplace for open
source solutions? And if fragmentation is indeed a problem in some
domains, what steps should the commu- nity take to align its projects,
talent, and resources?

![](media/image55.png)Global inclusion
--------------------------------------

While open source is flourishing globally, open source project leaders
outside of North America point to language, culture, and geopolitics
as genuine obstacles to their ability to maximize the par- ticipation
of talented developers. At the same time, rising global trade tensions
and political conflict risk politicizing decision-making and
participation in open source development communities. Rising
techno-nationalism, for example, has the world's advanced econ- omies
engaged in a high-stakes contest to reign supreme in key technological
domains. Could techno-nationalist policies balkanize OSS development
into regional silos and frustrate efforts to foster greater inclusion
and deepen the community's talent pool? Or could open source be the
key to avoiding balkanization across technology? As the scope and
diversity of the community increase, how can open source project
leaders integrate diverse participants and success- fully promulgate
open source norms, ethics, and best practices?

Open source governance
----------------------

Good governance is increasingly paramount as OSS becomes a vital
component of critical digital infrastructure. For example, quickly
identifying and rectifying security vulnerabilities requires timely
and effective coordination across the globally decentralized open
source community. Several open source foundations have stepped in to
help steward new initiatives designed to address the ecosystem's
vulnerabilities. However, the population of new open source
foundations continues to multiply, raising concerns about the impact
of organizational silos on cosystem governance. Are smaller, more
focused organizations more efficient and effective in addressing
narrower mandates defined by specific industries, regions, and
application spaces? Or will the continued proliferation of projects
and organizations impede efforts to create global stan- dards, address
security vulnerabilities, and promote the adoption of open source
solutions?

fragmentation in the open source ecosystem and investigate why it
occurs, where it is beneficial, where it is problematic, and what key
stakeholders are doing to confront the challenges of fragmentation.

    source collaboration and proposes strategies for reducing the risks
    of regional balkanization.

Enabling Innovation and Collaboration
=====================================

In a study of fragmentation in OSS ecosystems, Professor Christopher
Yoo at the University of Pennsylvania Law School posits that the
inherent freedom of action that characterizes OSS development creates
the potential for excessive fragmentation. Excessive frag- mentation,
Yoo alleges, creates a host of challenges for the open source
community. As Yoo put it:

#### "On the one hand, users' freedom to customize software is integral to the open source movement... On the other hand, infinite flexibility creates costs for the open source community by requiring the diffusion of effort and the duplication of work across multiple projects. Fragmentation also harms device manufacturers and app developers by limiting interoperability and by requiring them to adapt their products for what are now separate platforms."5

Yoo's research refers principally to the problem of forking in open
source development projects. He argues that the most extreme form of
fragmentation occurs when a contributor to an open source project
customizes the community's source code to the extent that it is no
longer fully interoperable with the rest of the project. The result is
to divide the system into two distinct and incompatible versions.
Given the economic inefficiencies that ensue, Yoo concludes that "some
constraints on the flexibility of open source are thus inevitable."6

In discussing fragmentation with open source leaders, a starting point
for many is the recognition that forking and duplication are
inevitable and often desirable consequences of a decentralized
ecosystem.

Decentralization, several argued, is not necessarily an optimal design
for efficiency, but it is a powerful engine for innovation. "The whole
open source world is a testament to the power of decentralization,"
said Rod Beckstrom, former CEO of ICANN and director of the U.S.
National Cybersecurity Center. "One conse- quence of decentralization
is overlap and redundancy. You cannot end the overlap without central
control. You can evolve or nudge a decentralized system, but there is
no means to control it."

Moreover, most participants of the study are comfortable with the
reality that a decentralized open source ecosystem will always feature
some inherent degree of disorder. As Mark Surman, presi- dent of the
Mozilla Foundation, put it, "The point of open source is that it's
decentralized. The ability to gather a set of people to col- laborate
around a particular problem or domain has always been the challenge
and opportunity of open source. Can we pool our

resources in a way that we can get enough value back out from the
resources that I am putting in? The freedom to convene and collab-
orate means you will never have perfect order."

More fundamentally, open source leaders argue that forking is part of
the standard workflow for open source projects and an essential aspect
of how software systems evolve and improve over time. "In good forks,
you take a code library and address a problem that the community has
not previously addressed," said Tim Bird, a senior software engineer
with Sony Mobile Communications. "Developers split off to address the
new problem and eventually come back together to reintegrate the new
code into the larger ecosystem." In practice, Jim Zemlin, executive
director of the Linux Foundation, points to several reasons to
fragment or fork a component, such as

addressing a significant technical problem or solving security issues.

The freedom to independently experiment with an existing code library
is especially beneficial when developers go off to try new

[]{#_bookmark7 .anchor}ideas, add new features, and explore new use
cases for OSS. "The codebases get stronger and stronger as a result,"
said Mike Dolan of the Linux Foundation, "because developers address
their specific use cases without breaking things for everybody else."
He adds, "The key part is that developers bring those new fragments
back into the core upstream open source project."

Ultimately, ecosystem leaders agree that decentralized collabora- tion
has resulted in a remarkable tapestry of independent open source
components that developers can put together to do some- thing bigger
and more useful. "We have a huge variety of software to choose from
now," said Bird. "In many ways, we are in the golden age of open
source." Jim Zemlin amplifies this point, noting that a typical
software package has 4,000 to 5,000 open source components. "The
availability of lots of reusable components dramatically increases the
efficiency of software development and speeds time to market," said
Zemlin. "Enterprises can innovate around the edges. They don't have to
build everything from scratch. The availability of reusable components
also prevents a lot of fragmentation because everyone is drawing from
the same code libraries. Nobody is taking the Linux kernel and
creating a new version."

Even when fragmentation produces overlap and redundancy, open source
leaders warn that attempts to control or curtail the freedom inherent
in open source development could be more harmful than the
fragmentation itself. "Fragmentation is the inno- vation engine," said
Mike Milinkovich, executive director of the Eclipse Foundation.
"Developers must be allowed to foster new ideas and projects. Anything
that brings a draconian order to the production side of the equation
is doomed to fail."

#### "Over time, competition between rival approaches gives way to increasing consolidation as market forces separate the winners from the losers."

 Fragmentation across the software landscape
-------------------------------------------

Open source leaders concede that fragmentation is not a grave problem
in the open source ecosystem but part of the essential life cycle in
how the community develops software. Fragmentation is not only normal
but largely healthy as well. As Astor Nummelin Carlberg, executive
director of OpenForum Europe, put it, "The resilience of the system
increases when there are competing alter- natives. Competition can
also drive innovation. The distributed nature of open source produces
a diversity of thought and differ- ent approaches to solving
problems."

However, looking across the software landscape, there is consid-
erable heterogeneity in the degree of fragmentation, and leaders
suggest that not all of it is desirable. Some domains are highly con-
solidated, while others feature a multiplicity of different software
packages. Typically, the level of fragmentation follows a maturity
curve where experimentation (and thus some inherent duplication of
effort) is highest in the early stages of developing applications for
a given domain. Over time, competition between rival approaches gives
way to increasing consolidation as market forces separate the winners
from the losers.

Several open source leaders point to Linux as a quintessential example
of healthy consolidation. "Linux has been around for 32 years," said
Alan Clark of the CTO Office at SUSE. "It's very mature. Sometimes you
get new community distributions of Linux, but they occupy particular
niches. In short, we see creativity around the edges, with developers
incorporating their innovations into the main kernel."

Jerry Cuomo, an IBM fellow and VP and CTO of Technology & Consulting,
adds that the open source community's ability to foster broad
participation in developing and using shared platforms has been
enormously beneficial. "Linux has been inviting for diverse col-
laboration for decades, but it also invites fierce competition," said
Cuomo. "You can contribute your piece to the kernel and then pull in

![](media/image57.png)

proprietary components to compete with other vendors. The key to its
success is the architecture and heavy-handed prescription about
keeping people focused on the core Linux kernel. The Apache web server
is another example of this. There is only one Apache server, and the
Web wouldn't be the same without it."

Several leaders argued that, in some domains, too much consoli- dation
is a more significant concern than too much fragmentation. "In the
core areas where open source is prominent, do we have the opposite
problem?" asks Mark Surman of the Mozilla Foundation. "Is open source
too concentrated? And when is concentration

okay? There's a big difference between the collaborative mainte- nance
of an open standard and the dominance of a single product. In
browsers, you could argue that we need more fragmentation, not less.
Look at Google's Chrome. It dominates the market."

By contrast, fragmentation is prominent in domains that are earlier in
the maturity cycle and where open source is less established. "Look at
various aspects of AI," said Surman. "It's still early days.

There are many players. Perhaps there is some fragmentation in machine
learning frameworks. But it should be up to the market to decide which
solutions, standards, and products will prevail."

Where else do open source leaders see challenges with fragmenta- tion?
As Tim Bird of Sony put it, "If you don't see the fragmentation, you
are not looking very hard. Just look at a range of stacks. There is
way too much software that does similar things. It becomes a burden.
Both the consumer electronics and automotive industries have issues.
Fragmentation in graphic APIs is very painful. There are no standards.
Everyone is doing their own thing."

Both Bird and Clark describe the embedded device space as rife with
fragmentation. "In embedded electronics, there is a natural tendency
to fragment," said Bird. "It is different from the desktop and
enterprise software space. To conserve resources, you tighten down the
screws and build software solutions that are highly cus- tomized to
the manufacturer's hardware. For example, the television stack is very
different across different manufacturers. Developers code the software
close to the metal to optimize performance. That causes a lot of
fragmentation."

Gabriele Columbro of FINOS and Linux Foundation Europe, on the other
hand, calls blockchain one of the most fragmented domains. "There are
too many foundations, platforms, standards, and cur- rencies," said
Columbro. "Many players call themselves open source but not openly
governed. The result is a proliferation of forks. You don't get
consolidation when you don't have clear and

transparent governance."

Fragmentation challenges and solutions
--------------------------------------

#### "Open source is reducing fragmentation, not causing it."

Several leaders consulted for the study see what they describe as
problematic instances of fragmentation in the development of

open source solutions. So, what are the potential costs to the eco-
system? The principal downsides of fragmentation are increased cost
and complexity for consumers and vendors of open source solutions.
Fragmentation can also reduce the open source effect of having a large
community collaborate around a shared platform or standard, resulting
in a less efficient deployment of resources.

For vendors, the proliferation of competing projects places a more
significant burden on their capacity to support customers. "The
disadvantage of fragmentation is that it increases costs and

causes vendors to deploy more resources," said Alan Clark of SUSE.
"You must track what is going on, assess the efficacy of different
approaches, and sometimes you have to support multiple solu- tions for
your customers. The duplication of effort equals more resources and
more cost. And then it creates a challenge around standards and
compatibility issues."

#### "Without open source, the redundancy and fragmentation just happen behind closed doors with lots of individual proprietary projects." **- STORMY PETERS**

On the other hand, end users of open source solutions maintain that
the proliferation of projects makes it more challenging to identify,
test, and deploy suitable code libraries. Tim Bird of Sony, for
example, argues that fragmentation in the software environ- ment adds
time and cost to the development process for device manufacturers. "We
look for open source code libraries to tackle particular problems,"
said Bird, "but when the open source projects proliferate, it requires
a lot of research and customization to find

a library that is suitable for our needs." Maintenance is another
challenge, according to Bird. "When new forks emerge, it splits

the community and results in fewer developers on each fork to fix bugs
or address security concerns. Fragmentation creates duplica- tion of
effort. We lose the open source effect."

According to Jerry Cuomo of IBM, fragmentation can create addi- tional
inefficiencies in the marketplace for solutions. "For open source to
work well on the business side, you need a healthy eco- system of
competing solutions that orbit around shared platforms," said Cuomo.
"An enterprise that uses open source needs to know that the vendor
will support its solution. Can I trust it? Is it secure? What if the
vendor lets you down? What do you do?" Cuomo and others note that
enterprises can freely move from vendor to vendor when the vendors
work around a shared platform. "They can go for better prices and
better solutions," said Cuomo. "It creates healthy competition and
lowers lock-in and switching costs for enterprise users.
Non-fragmented ecosystems create an open economy. When it's
fragmented, you don't have that as much."

For the broader ecosystem of contributors to open source solu- tions,
there is an argument that duplication and redundancy rep- resent an
inefficient deployment of the community's resources. "On the one hand,
you can argue that overlapping or redundant efforts are a waste of
talent and resources," said Astor Nummelin Carlberg of OpenForum
Europe. "On the other hand, we also see gaps in the marketplace, with
competing projects in high-demand areas and less focus on critical
areas that demand attention."

In the final analysis, fragmentation is a double-edged sword. On the
one hand, the software ecosystem needs healthy competition between
rival ideas and approaches. Nobody consulted for the study wants to
reduce fragmentation at the expense of competi- tion and innovation.
Moreover, looking across the entire software landscape, there is a
solid case to be made that open source is reducing fragmentation, not
causing it. As Stormy Peters of GitHub put it, "Without open source,
the redundancy and fragmentation just happen behind closed doors with
lots of individual propri- etary projects."

![](media/image59.png)On the other hand, leaders acknowledge that a
decentralized open source ecosystem will inevitably produce duplicate
projects and, thus, some inefficiencies for vendors and other partici-
pants. "For a company like SUSE and other vendors," said Clark,
"duplication creates a challenge because we need to be selective
regarding which projects we will support. Which projects offer the
most robust solution and a supportable future? Which solu- tions are
the most relevant to our customers?"

Some enterprise leaders suggested that open source foundations could
intervene in fragmented domains by helping to identify and champion
winning solutions. However, foundation leaders pushed back on this
idea, asserting that market forces rather than founda- tions should
determine the winners. "We help competitors, suppli- ers, and
customers all work together and build things in a neutral forum," said
Mike Dolan of the Linux Foundation. "And, in an open forum where
anybody can participate, people vote by showing

up. If they show up with their developers, resources, and buying
power, those projects can become de facto standards. That's how the
tech industry picks winners."

Most open source leaders agree that when the ecosystem follows open
source principles, the fragmentation and duplication of effort

get resolved over time. "We want to see different ideas in a new
space, and we want them to try them out in rapid succession," said
Mike Milinkovich of Eclipse. "Open source is the best way to do that.

You do not want to corral that innovation; we want to encourage it.
Competition will determine the winners and losers. Over time, projects
will consolidate, and the ecosystem can move forward."

Open source leaders also insist that intelligent project design can go
a long way toward reducing unnecessary fragmenta- tion. Establishing
neutral, inclusive, and transparent structures for collaboration will
broaden the tent and reduce incentives to create parallel efforts.
"When we launch a project, we do it in a way that says this is going
to be neutral," said Mike Dolan of the

Linux Foundation. He points to Kubernetes, where Google went to great
lengths to distribute control over the project and reassure other
contributors that Google was ready and willing to collabo- rate.
"Google could have open sourced Kubernetes and kept all the maintainer
control," said Dolan. "Instead, they handed off key parts of the
codebase to other companies and leaders who proved very capable of
doing it. In doing so, Google got broad buy-in and helped make
Kubernetes the de facto standard for the industry."
