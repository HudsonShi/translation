## 结论

In its purest form, OSS development is a way of producing software that relies entirely on self-organizing communities of individuals who come together voluntarily to work on a software project. However, most successful OSS communities mix elements of hierarchy and self-organization and rely on meritocratic principles of organiza- tion. In other words, the most skilled and experienced community members provide leadership and help integrate contributions from the community.

在其最纯粹的形式中，开源软件开发是一种完全依靠自我组织的个人社区自愿聚集在一起工作的方式。然而，大多数成功的开源社区都混合了等级制度和自我组织的元素，并依赖于组织的精英主义原则。换句话说，最有技能和经验的社区成员提供领导，并帮助整合社区的贡献。

This combination of decentralized innovation and effective leadership is integral to the long-term viability and success of open source projects. As Professor Christopher Yoo put it, "Success of an open source project depends on inspiring a community of people willing to work on it. In a real sense, an open source leader's authority depends on the existence of followers. In a world where all contributions are voluntary, and the community is always free to exit the community by forking the project, leaders' ability to retain their positions depends largely on their responsiveness to the needs of those led. These needs include providing fast feedback, serving as an effective moderator of technical disputes and personality conflicts, and realistic interim and long-term goals."30

这种分散式创新和有效的领导力的结合对于开源项目的长期生存能力和成功至关重要。正如Christopher Yoo教授所说：“开源项目的成功取决于激发一群愿意为之工作的人的社区。从某种意义上说，开源领导者的权威性取决于追随者的存在。在所有贡献都是自愿的、社区始终可以通过分叉项目自由退出的世界中，领导者保留其职位的能力在很大程度上取决于他们对被领导者需求的反应性。这些需求包括提供快速反馈、作为技术争议和个性冲突的有效调解者、以及制定现实的中期和长期目标。”30

The Linux ecosystem provides an excellent example of how leader- ship and strong governance can reduce fragmentation. In the early days of Linux, Linus Torvalds' role as the project leader was instru- mental in averting the risk of fragmentation and project forking.

Linux生态系统提供了一个极好的例子，说明领导力和强有力的治理可以减少分裂。在Linux的早期，Linus Torvalds作为项目领导者的角色对避免分裂和项目分叉的风险起了重要作用。

Torvalds' status as Linux's creator made him the natural person to exercise authority over the community. When required, Torvalds did not hesitate to take action to prevent significant forks from emerging. However, he bolstered his authority by taking great care to document and justify his decisions. His dedication and sound judgment in managing the community fostered considerable goodwill, as did his deft touch in handling community politics and interpersonal dynamics. Ultimately, that transparency also enabled Linus to delegate decisionmaking for the codebase to core maintainers, who have over decades grown to be the core engine of contribution to and maintenance of the modern Linux kernel.

Torvalds作为Linux的创始人，天然地成为行使社区权威的人。在需要时，Torvalds毫不犹豫地采取行动，防止出现重大分叉。然而，他通过认真记录和证明自己的决策来增强自己的权威性。他在管理社区方面的奉献精神和明智的判断力，培养了相当多的善意，他在处理社区政治和人际动态方面的娴熟手法也赢得了赞誉。最终，这种透明度也使Linus能够将代码库的决策委托给核心维护人员，他们在几十年的时间里成为现代Linux内核贡献和维护的核心引擎。

As Professor Yoo concludes, "To say that open source projects require a type of leadership that is somewhat different from the leadership that characterizes commercial companies that produce proprietary software is not to say that they need no leadership at all. On the contrary, ensuring that an open source platform does not fragment depends on the presence of an actor with sufficient authority to resolve disputes and to steer the platform in a beneficial direction."31

正如尤教授所总结的：“说开源项目需要的领导方式与生产专有软件的商业公司的领导方式有所不同，并不意味着它们不需要领导。相反，确保开源平台不会分裂取决于一个具有足够权威来解决争端并将平台引导到有益方向的行动者的存在。”31

In discussions for the study, open source leaders offered several additional concrete recommendations to address some of the pain points described in this report. We divide the recommendations into two broad categories: a) managing fragmentation in the development and governance of open source solutions and b) confronting techno-nationalism and fostering global inclusion.

在研究讨论中，开源领袖提供了几个额外的具体建议，以解决本报告中描述的一些痛点。我们将这些建议分为两大类：a) 管理开源解决方案的开发和治理中的分裂，b) 应对技术民族主义并促进全球包容。

### Managing fragmentation

### 管理分裂

The recommendations for managing fragmentation in the development and governance of open source solutions include forging greater alignment between open source projects, strengthening inter-foundation collaboration, and harnessing open source maturity models to help identify robust code libraries and components.

管理开源解决方案开发和治理中的分裂的建议包括加强开源项目之间的协调，加强基金会间的合作，利用开源成熟度模型来帮助识别稳健的代码库和组件。

##### HARNESS MATURITY MODELS

##### 利用成熟度模型

While open source leaders acknowledge some fragmentation-related challenges, they warn that "solving" the fragmentation problem risks killing the goose that laid the golden egg. "When people perceive fragmentation, they often look at it from a consumer point of view," said Mike Milinkovich of the Eclipse Foundation. "They see a broad landscape of possible solutions and wonder what is safe, what is supported, and what is sustainable." Rather than "solving fragmentation," Milinkovich and others suggest that an open source maturity model would make it easier to identify robust code libraries and components and thus focus the community's efforts. As Mike Dolan put it, "The proliferation of open source projects is not necessarily bad. It just means that there are many options out there. It also means that we need better filters to make it easy for developers and end users to discover the little modules that do things that are useful for them."

虽然开源领袖们承认了一些与分裂相关的挑战，但他们警告说，“解决”分裂问题可能会毁掉下金蛋的鹅。 “当人们看到分裂时，他们通常会从消费者的角度来看待它，” Eclipse基金会的Mike Milinkovich说道，“他们看到了许多可能的解决方案，想知道什么是安全的，什么是得到支持的，什么是可持续的。” Milinkovich和其他人建议，与其“解决分裂”，不如采用开源成熟度模型来更容易地识别出稳健的代码库和组件，从而集中社区的努力。正如Mike Dolan所说，“开源项目的扩散不一定是坏事，这只是意味着有很多选择。这也意味着我们需要更好的过滤器，以便开发人员和最终用户可以发现对他们有用的小模块。”

##### ENLIST SKILLED COMMUNITY MANAGERS

##### 征召熟练的社区经理

If effective leadership is integral to successful open source projects, then skilled community managers are the foot soldiers for building high-performing collaboration networks.

如果有效的领导是成功的开源项目的不可或缺的一部分，那么有技能的社区经理是构建高效协作网络的步兵。

Unfortunately, in a world dominated by proprietary technologies, few people understand how to create and grow an open source ecosystem. However, Calista Redmond of RISC-V points out that technologists are adapting to a new way of working as open stan- dards increasingly overtake proprietary approaches. "Ethernet is a great example," said Redmond, "where proprietary approaches are now nearly nonexistent." Redmond and her colleagues have built the RISC-V community from scratch to become the world's most popular open and widely used microprocessor instruction set architecture standard. Along the way, RISC-V encountered numerous concerns about forking, especially when companies in the ecosystem identified missing pieces and had the temptation to develop proprietary solutions.

不幸的是，在一个被专有技术主导的世界里，很少有人了解如何创建和发展开源生态系统。然而，RISC-V的Calista Redmond指出，随着开放标准逐渐取代专有方法，技术人员正在适应新的工作方式。“以太网就是一个很好的例子，”Redmond说，“在那里，专有方法现在几乎不存在了。”Redmond和她的同事们从零开始建立了RISC-V社区，成为了全球最受欢迎的开放式和广泛使用的微处理器指令集架构标准。在此过程中，RISC-V遇到了许多关于分叉的问题，特别是当生态系统中的公司发现缺失的部分并有诱惑开发专有解决方案时。

To avoid fragmentation in the community, Redmond and her team work hard to gather participants and align efforts on the missing pieces. "We have to run really fast to catch up with our community," said Redmond. "It's a different skill set. Most people have built proprietary strongholds. We need people who know how to orchestrate true collaboration. Our CTO comes from Sun Microsystems, where he was responsible for Solaris. He is very community-oriented. You need to find those people with the skills for ecosystem leadership."

为了避免社区的碎片化，Redmond和她的团队努力汇集参与者，并协调努力解决缺失的部分。Redmond说，“我们必须跟上我们的社区。”这需要不同的技能。大多数人都建立了专有领地，我们需要那些知道如何协调真正协作的人。我们的首席技术官来自Sun Microsystems，在那里他负责Solaris。他非常注重社区。你需要找到那些具备生态系统领导技能的人。

##### ALIGN OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS AROUND SHARED GOALS

##### 将开源项目围绕共同目标进行整合

Open source foundations are reluctant to play a lead role in identi- fying and championing winning open source projects, arguing that picking winners is a marketplace function. However, leaders do see a need for better project curation and want foundations and other ecosystem participants to make greater efforts to align projects with similar objectives. "We nurture multiple projects, and some- times they overlap," said Gabriele Columbro, general manager of [**Linux Foundation Europe**](https://linuxfoundation.eu/). "But the most mature foundations have a project life cycle where they can help coalesce efforts and even consolidate projects." Columbro says that survival of the fittest, or "open source Darwinism," will usually dictate which projects are ultimately sustainable. However, he and other open source leaders agree that bringing similar projects under a shared umbrella can eliminate duplication, economize overhead, and reduce so-called "vendor fatigue." In some instances, foundations could also do a better job killing or archiving projects. "We are very good at bringing projects in," said Columbro. "But it's equally important we do a great job cycling projects through the life cycle and shelving projects when necessary."
开源基金会不愿扮演识别和推广优胜开源项目的主导角色，他们认为挑选优胜者是市场的职能。然而，领导人们认为需要更好的项目筛选，并希望基金会和其他生态系统参与者在更好地将项目与相似目标对齐方面做出更大努力。Linux Foundation Europe的总经理Gabriele Columbro表示：“我们培养多个项目，有时它们会重叠。但最成熟的基金会都有一个项目生命周期，在那里他们可以帮助凝聚努力，甚至整合项目。”Columbro说，适者生存或“开源达尔文主义”通常决定哪些项目最终是可持续的。然而，他和其他开源领导人都同意，将类似的项目纳入一个共享的伞下可以消除重复、节约开销并减少所谓的“供应商疲劳”。在某些情况下，基金会还可以更好地关闭或归档项目。Columbro说：“我们很擅长引入项目。但同样重要的是，我们要在适当的时候将项目引导通过生命周期，并对其进行归档。”

##### STRENGTHEN INTER-FOUNDATION COLLABORATION ON ECOSYSTEM CHALLENGES

##### 加强基金会间在生态系统挑战方面的合作

The need for enhanced collaboration between open source projects and foundations extends to other priorities for the ecosys- tem, including joint efforts to advance open source advocacy on a range of Internet governance issues. Mark Surman of the Mozilla Foundation said foundation leaders could leverage the communi- ty's shared values as a starting point for collaboration. "The open source community is united by core values such as independence, decentralization, public assets, and public benefits," said Surman. "In essence, we agree on the vital role of the commons." The next step is to convene the foundation leaders and work together to identify shared policy goals. "What are possible threads of unity, and to what ends should we pull them?" asks Surman.

加强开源项目和基金会之间的协作需要在生态系统的其他优先事项方面，包括联合努力推进一系列互联网治理问题的开源倡导工作。Mozilla基金会的Mark Surman表示，基金会领导人可以利用社区的共同价值观作为合作的起点。“开源社区的核心价值观，如独立性、去中心化、公共资产和公共利益，使我们团结在一起，”Surman说。“实际上，我们都认同公共资源的重要作用。”下一步是召集基金会领导人并共同努力，以确定共享政策目标。“我们可以找到哪些团结的纽带，并达到什么目的呢？”Surman问道。

One goal that all ecosystem leaders agree on is the need to build trust and confidence in OSS and support the ongoing maintenance of critical open source infrastructure. "The cybersecurity order from the White House has put the ecosystem on notice," said Jerry Cuomo of IBM. "Now, the stewards of open source need to step up. It would be huge if the community had a shared ledger and audit system where we could demonstrate that the software is robust and secure. We need a transparent, ecosystem-wide view of our vulnerabilities, and we need to be able to predict potential problems. That's an OSS service that the community can trust."

所有生态系统领导者都同意一个目标，即需要建立对开源软件的信任和信心，并支持关键开源基础设施的持续维护。 "来自白宫的网络安全令让生态系统警觉起来，" IBM 的 Jerry Cuomo 表示。 "现在，开源软件的管理者需要站出来。如果社区拥有一个共享的分类账和审计系统，能够证明软件是强大和安全的，那将是巨大的。我们需要一个透明、全生态系统范围内的漏洞视图，并且我们需要能够预测潜在问题。这是社区可以信任的开源软件服务。"

Open source security and sustainability are top of mind, but eco- system leaders point to various policy issues on which open source foundations could find common ground. "The foundations should do more to educate policymakers and work on shared issues such as data security, intellectual property, antitrust, and privacy, among other things," said Peixin Hou of Huawei. "We urgently need global action on these issues."

开源安全和可持续性是当前的主要问题，但是生态系统领导者指出，开源基金会可以在数据安全、知识产权、反垄断和隐私等共同关注的政策问题上找到共同点。 "基金会应该更多地教育决策者，共同解决诸如数据安全、知识产权、反垄断和隐私等问题，" 华为的 Peixin Hou 表示。 "我们迫切需要全球性的行动来解决这些问题。"

### Confronting techno-nationalism and fostering global inclusion

### 应对技术民族主义和促进全球包容

The recommendations for confronting techno-nationalism and fostering global inclusion include positioning foundations as neutral actors, building reputation frameworks and audit systems for open source code, and creating tools and protocols for inte- grating diverse contributors into open source communities.

应对技术民族主义和促进全球包容的建议包括将基金会定位为中立的参与者、建立针对开源代码的声誉框架和审计系统，以及创建整合多元贡献者到开源社区的工具和协议。

##### BUILD REPUTATION FRAMEWORKS

##### 建立声誉框架

Adherence to transparent and secure development protocols is, ultimately, the best antidote to fears that national interests could taint or even corrupt open source projects. "To counter the tech- no-nationalism, we need to instill trust in the software develop- ment process," said Jim Zemlin. For example, Zemlin proposes the creation of reputation frameworks with better peer review and third-party audits. "We need trust networks that are transparent and scalable enough to work across open source communities," said Zemlin. "You can think of it as a liquidity of trust. Where you are from and whom you work for are not as relevant as knowing that your work is trustworthy and high-quality. It's the code that is vital. So we need a reputation framework for the codebase."

遵循透明和安全的开发协议，最终是消除国家利益可能玷污或甚至破坏开源项目的最佳解决方案。"为了抵制技术民族主义，我们需要在软件开发过程中建立信任,"Jim Zemlin说。例如，Zemlin建议创建具有更好的同行评审和第三方审计的声誉框架。"我们需要透明和可扩展到所有开源社区的信任网络，" Zemlin说。"你来自哪里，以及你为谁工作并不重要，知道你的工作是值得信任和高质量的才是重要的。所以我们需要针对代码库的声誉框架。"

##### POSITION FOUNDATIONS AND PROJECTS AS NEUTRAL ACTORS

##### 将基金会和项目定位为中立参与者

In addition to reputation frameworks, positioning open source foundations and projects as impartial actors is critical to creating a neutral home for global collaboration. Establishing neutral, inclusive, and transparent structures for collaboration will not only broaden participation but can also reduce incentives for ecosystem participants to create parallel efforts. Reflecting on his work at ICANN, Rod Beckstrom said his number-one job was building a neutral zone in the domain name system that holds the Internet together. "We did everything we could to bring China and Russia into the tent," said Beckstrom. "We were doing it for the global community. Otherwise, we are starting from a position of mistrust." Likewise, building confidence in ICANN's protocols and decision-making process was critical to creating a produc- tive relationship with countries that were suspicious of American dominance of Internet governance. "As long as the system works openly and fairly, everyone can participate," said Beckstrom. "The Internet is a global infrastructure---it must remain neutral. It's to the benefit of the world."

除了声誉框架之外，将开源基金会和项目定位为公正的参与者对于创建全球合作的中立家园至关重要。建立中立、包容和透明的合作结构不仅可以扩大参与度，还可以减少生态系统参与者创建平行努力的动机。在回顾他在ICANN的工作时，Rod Beckstrom说他的首要工作是在维持互联网的域名系统中建立一个中立区域。"我们尽了一切努力将中国和俄罗斯纳入帐篷，" Beckstrom说。"我们为全球社区而这么做。否则，我们将从不信任的立场开始。"同样，建立对ICANN协议和决策过程的信心对于与对美国互联网治理主导怀有怀疑态度的国家建立富有成效的关系至关重要。"只要系统公开、公正，每个人都可以参与，" Beckstrom说。"互联网是全球基础设施——必须保持中立。这对世界有利。"

##### EDUCATE POLICYMAKERS ABOUT THE DOWNSIDES OF TECHNO-NATIONALISM

##### 教育决策者有关技术民族主义的弊端

To combat techno-nationalism, ecosystem leaders must convince policymakers that restricting the transfer of critical innovations across national borders is paradoxical and self-defeating in a world where cross-border collaborations are the backbone of countless innovation communities. Calista Redmond and others argue that open source and global standards provide a superior path for both local and global economic growth because global collaboration leads to global markets with long-term strategic importance. “Every country has a home-team bias, but the growing techno-nationalism is a major concern,” said Redmond. “We need to educate the community and the policymakers about the downsides of techno-nationalism. Countries can fund companies and initiatives locally, but they must participate globally. Countries won’t be successful if they close off collaboration at national borders.” Columbro even adopted that perspective as a motto to define the mission of Linux Foundation Europe: “Collaborate locally, innovate globally.”

为了应对技术民族主义，生态系统领袖必须说服政策制定者，限制跨国界传递关键创新是矛盾和自我毁灭的，因为跨国界合作是无数创新社区的支柱。Calista Redmond和其他人认为，开源和全球标准为本地和全球经济增长提供了更优越的道路，因为全球合作导致具有长期战略重要性的全球市场。Redmond表示：“每个国家都有一种本土偏见，但不断增长的技术民族主义是一个重大问题。我们需要教育社区和政策制定者关于技术民族主义的不利因素。国家可以在本地资助公司和计划，但必须全球参与。如果关闭国家边界上的合作，国家就不会成功。”Columbro甚至将这一观点作为Linux Foundation Europe定义使命的座右铭：“本地合作，全球创新。”

##### CREATE THE CONDITIONS TO INTEGRATE DIVERSE CONTRIBUTORS

##### 创造条件以整合不同贡献者

The challenges of integrating different languages and cultures into open source communities are not new problems, and there is considerable confidence in the ecosystem's capacity to foster global inclusion. As Stormy Peters at GitHub explains, "The open source community has been integrating diversity for a long time. We have people contributing from across Europe, Asia, Africa, and South America. We have always understood the importance of international networks and communications, even more than the corporate community. We have leveraged asynchronous commu- nications to address the fact that users in some regions had less Internet bandwidth."

将不同语言和文化融入开源社区的挑战并不是新问题，生态系统在促进全球包容方面有相当的信心。正如GitHub的Stormy Peters所解释的那样，“开源社区一直在整合多样性。我们有来自欧洲、亚洲、非洲和南美的贡献者。我们一直理解国际网络和通信的重要性，甚至比企业社区更重要。我们利用异步通信来解决一些地区用户的互联网带宽较低的问题。”

The sheer number of people that GitHub and other organizations are onboarding into the global open source community provides proof of the ecosystem's progress in integrating diverse contributors. "We have proven that open source projects can operate globally," said Peters. "We are working effectively across regions and in multiple languages. We are creating OSPOs to structure the engagement of companies and organizations with the open source community."

GitHub和其他组织吸纳到全球开源社区的人数之多，证明了这个生态系统在整合不同贡献者方面取得了进展。“我们已经证明开源项目可以在全球范围内运作，”Peters表示。“我们在跨区域和多语言方面的合作非常有效。我们正在创建OSPO来规范公司和组织与开源社区的互动。”

Open source leaders agree, however, that the community can do more to promote global inclusion. For example, open source leaders underlined the need to invest in rapid machine translation capabilities for project communications. Open source leaders also discussed the importance of promoting open source norms, taming the industry's macho "bro" culture, and fostering professionalism in community dialogues and decision-making. Finally, collaboration platforms such as GitHub can enable open source communities to integrate diverse contributions at scale. Key advances in the GitHub platform include new tools to improve collaboration, translate mate- rials, and monitor the productivity and engagement of community members. "We believe we have the tools to bring open source col- laboration to a new level," said Peters.

然而，开源领导人们认为社区可以做更多来促进全球包容。例如，开源领导人强调了投资于快速机器翻译能力以进行项目通信的必要性。开源领导人还讨论了在社区对话和决策中促进开源规范、驯服行业的“兄弟文化”和培养专业精神的重要性。最后，GitHub等协作平台可以使开源社区在规模上整合多样化的贡献。GitHub平台的关键进展包括新工具来改进协作、翻译材料以及监测社区成员的生产力和参与度。“我们相信我们有工具可以将开源协作提升到一个新的水平，”Peters说道。

### Final thoughts

### 总结

By any yardstick, OSS is wildly successful. Hundreds of millions of users of set-top boxes, smart fridges, and other home appli- ances use OSS, and billions of people use it indirectly whenever they access Google, Facebook, or the myriad of other apps and websites. Whether you drive a Tesla, Toyota, or Mercedes, chances are very high it's running Linux and open source in the back- ground.32 So too are the supercomputers that power everything from advanced climate models to AI-enabled drug discovery and other scientific pursuits, such as astronomy, meteorology, and nuclear physics.33

无论用什么标准来衡量，开源软件系统都非常成功。数亿用户使用机顶盒、智能冰箱和其他家用电器使用OSS，而数十亿人在访问Google、Facebook或无数其他应用程序和网站时也在间接使用OSS。无论你开特斯拉、丰田还是奔驰，它背后很有可能都在运行Linux和开源软件。超级计算机也是如此，它们为从先进气候模型到支持AI药物发现和其他科学研究（如天文学、气象学和核物理学）的一切提供动力。

The global open source community powering these innovations is encountering some inevitable fragmentation. Some of the frag- mentation in software development is essential to how the open source community functions. A globally decentralized ecosystem may produce some overlap, but its constant churn of incremen- tal innovation and improvement has yielded a vast reservoir of software building blocks for the digital economy.

支持这些创新的全球开源社区遇到了一些不可避免的分化。软件开发中的一些分化对于开源社区的运作至关重要。全球分散的生态系统可能会产生一些重叠，但其不断的渐进式创新和改进已经产生了一个庞大的软件构建块库，为数字经济提供支持。

In other instances, fragmentation in the community is creating needless redundancy, driving up costs and complexity for producers and consumers alike. Worst of all, intensifying techno- nationalism could introduce new geopolitical fault lines, disrupting the free flow of ideas and restricting the community's access to talented developers.

在其他情况下，社区的分化正在创造不必要的冗余，增加生产者和消费者的成本和复杂性。最糟糕的是，日益加剧的技术民族主义可能会引入新的地缘政治断层，扰乱思想的自由流动，并限制社区获取才华横溢的开发人员的能力。

Now it is up to the community of developers, public and private sector organizations, companies, foundations, and beyond to continue to push for global collaboration. The open source commu- nity is larger, more diverse, and more capable than ever, but its progress is not forever inevitable. It is incumbent upon the commu- nity's leaders to take the necessary steps to continue these trendlines into the future.

现在，推动全球合作的责任在于开发者社区、公共和私营部门组织、公司、基金会等等。开源社区比以往任何时候都更加庞大、多样化和能力强大，但其进步并非永远不可避免。社区的领导者有责任采取必要的步骤，将这些趋势延续到未来。
