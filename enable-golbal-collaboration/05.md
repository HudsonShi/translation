Breaking Down the Governance Silos
==================================

突破治理壁垒
==================================

Most of the early open source projects, including Linux and Apache,
grew out of the voluntary efforts of a small but dispersed group of
individuals. As the projects gained commercial traction, concerned
stakeholders came together to create nonprofit orga- nizations that
could provide the legal and economic infrastructure for ongoing
community collaboration and make projects such as Linux less dependent
on the individuals who initiated them. The resulting OSS foundations,
including the Linux Foundation, the Apache Software Foundation, and
others, are now integral to the open source ecosystem.

大多数早期开源项目，包括Linux和Apache，都是通过少数分散的个人自发努力而发展起来的。随着项目获得商业吸引力，相应的利益相关者聚集在一起创建了非营利组织，能够为正在进行的社区合作提供法律支持和经济基础，并减少诸如Linux这些项目对发起人个体的依赖。由此产生的OSS基金会，例如Linux基金会、Apache软件基金会等，如今都成为了开源生态系统的组成部分。

The creation of new open source projects has seen a commensurate
increase in the number of new foundations. Javier Cánovas of the
Universitat Oberta de Catalunya recently led an empirical study of
open source foundations and found over 100 active entities across a
wide range of open source projects.21 As Cánovas observes:

伴随着新开源项目的创建，新基金会的数量也有了相应的增加。加泰罗尼亚开放大学的Javier Cánovas最近领导了一项关于开源基金会的实证研究，并在众多开源项目中发现了超过100个活跃的实体21。Cánovas经过观察得出： 

#### "The survival of an OSS project largely depends on its ability to retain developers, onboard new ones (i.e., newcomers), and create a community of users who promote its adoption and use. As these

#### projects grow, developers tend to organize and build communities. Still, many lack formal governance models to structure and manage the (potentially large) community around them (and the challenges this implies). Support to deal with all kinds of organizational decisions (including legal and economic aspects)

#### is a huge concern for all projects at this stage."

#### “一个OSS项目的存续在很大程度上取决于它是否有能力留下开发者、吸收新的开发人员（即新人），以及创建一个帮助其被采纳和使用的用户社区。随着这些项目的发展，开发者倾向于社区的组织和构建。尽管如此，许多公司仍然缺乏正式的治理模型来构建和管理其（可能很大的）外延社区（以及其中的挑战）。对执行各种组织决策（包括法律和经济方面）的支持是这个阶段所有项目的一大焦点。”

While mandates vary from organization to organization, foun- dations
typically set the stage for collaboration on open source projects. The
roles include building tools and processes to enable collaborative development, hosting a structured gover- nance
process for steering the evolution of open source projects, handling
legal issues (particularly around intellectual property licensing, 
trademarks, and patents), and engaging with policymak- ers and
regulators. Many foundations also play a role in educa- tion,
training, and marketing. Across these domains, foundations provide a
legal entity to hire staff and raise funds to pay for activi- ties
that benefit the community.

虽然各个组织的授权有所不同，但基金会通常会为开源项目的合作奠定基础。其作用包括构建可以支持开发的工具和流程，主持结构化的治理流程以指导开源项目的发展，处理法律事务（特别是关于知识产权许可、商标和专利的问题），以及与决策者和监管者进行沟通。许多基金会还在教育、培训和营销方面发挥作用。在这些领域中，基金会提供了一个法人实体来雇佣员工和筹集经费去资助有益于社区的活动。

The sheer number of foundations identified in
[Cánovas](https://livablesoftware.com/author/jlcanovas/)' empiri- cal
study raises a question as to whether the governance of OSS is now too
diffuse to enable sufficient progress on the challenges 
facing the community. For example, has the proliferation of founda-
tions created a crowded field that could ultimately impede efforts to
develop global standards, address security vulnerabilities,
and promote the adoption of open source solutions? And does a crowded
field make it more difficult for interested stakeholders to determine
how and where to allocate their time and resources?

实证研究过程中，Cánovas在确定基金会的实际数量时提出了一个问题，即当前的OSS治理是否过于分散，以至于无法在社区面临的挑战上取得足够的进展。例如，基金会的激增是否创造了一片红海，最终可能阻碍全球标准的制定、安全漏洞的解决和促进采用开源解决方案的努力？一个拥挤的领域是否会让感兴趣的利益相关者更难决定如何以及在哪里分配他们的时间和资源。

Several open source leaders consulted for the study agreed that the
proliferation of open source foundations and projects has become
problematic. They worry, for example, that the flurry of new open
source projects and associations for narrow verticals will pull key
stakeholders in too many directions. As one inter- viewee put it,
"Quite frankly, none of the participants has a clue how to do open
source. It is disconcerting. The probability of success is very low.
Their scope is too narrowly focused. They don't understand that open
source is a unique discipline they don't have the skills to master."

为该研究提供咨询的几位开源领导者一致认为，开源基金会和项目的激增已经成为问题。举例来说，他们担心新的开源项目和针对狭窄垂直领域的协会将把重要的利益相关者拉向过多的方向。正如一位受访者所言，“坦率地讲，没有一个参与者知道如何做开源。这让人感到不安。成功的希望渺茫。这些人的局限太狭窄了。他们不明白开源是一门独特的学科，并没有掌握相关技能。”

The proliferation of new foundations has already led some enter-
prises to be more selective about how and where they engage. For
example, Deborah Bryant, formerly of Red Hat, notes that her OSPO was
spending more time re-evaluating the firm's

![](media/image64.png)participation in software foundations on a
regular cadence to "ensure that \[Red Hat was\] getting a return on
its investment."22

新基金会的激增已经导致一些企业在参与方式和领域上更加挑剔。例如，曾受雇于红帽公司的Deborah Bryant表示，她的OSPO正在耗费更多时间来定期重新评估公司对软件基金会的参与，以“确保（红帽）从投资中获得回报”。22

#### "As vendors, we must determine which foundations and projects our customers care about. It's time consuming." **- ALAN CLARKE**

#### “作为供应商，我们必须确定我们的客户关心哪些基金会和项目。这是一件很耗时的事情。” **——ALAN CLARKE**

Meanwhile, Alan Clarke of SUSE acknowledges that foundations are
businesses and that they ultimately compete for members and

revenues. But the imperative to increase memberships and revenues by
launching new projects creates what he and others describe as "vendor
fatigue" and "engagement overload." "Foundations create projects to
address the sexy spaces in hopes that doing so will boost memberships
and revenues," said Clark. "The result may be multiple different
approaches to the same problem, and you get fragmented solutions.
Then, as vendors, we must determine which founda-

tions and projects our customers care about. Which projects will
address the real market needs, and which will be successful? It's
time-consuming."

与此同时，来自SUSE的Alan Clarke承认，基金会也是企业，他们最终所争夺的是会员和收益。但是，通过推出新项目来增加会员数量和收益的必然性，导致了大家所说的“卖方疲劳”和“用户参与过载”。Clark表示：“基金会通过创建项目来提高吸引力，并希望借此增加会员数量和收益。”“结果可能是同一问题出现多种不同的解决方法，你会得到碎片化的解决方案。因此，作为供应商，我们必须确定客户所关心的是哪些基金会和项目。哪些项目将满足真正的市场需求，哪些项目将获得成功？这是一件很耗时的事情。”

Nevertheless, some argued that creating new OSS foundations is
justified if they can mobilize more efficiently and effectively to

address narrower mandates defined by specific industries, regions, and
application spaces. "Policymakers realize that open source is

a vital part of the innovation economy," said Mike Milinkovich of the
Eclipse Foundation. "To protect the future prosperity of their
citizens, they need to understand and participate in open source.
Inevitably there will be verticals and jurisdictions where stakehold-
ers take solace from working with organizations that speak their
language and have similar norms and legal frameworks."

尽管如此，一些人仍然坚信，如果能够更有效地动员新的OSS基金会来解决由特定行业、地区和应用空间定义的更垂直赛道，那么创建新的OSS基金会是合理的。“决策者意识到开源是经济创新的重要组成部分，”Eclipse基金会的Mike Milinkovich表示。“为了保护公民未来的繁荣，他们需要理解和参与开源。不可避免地，在某些领域和司法范围内，利益相关者会通过与说自己语言、拥有类似规范和法律框架的组织合作中获得安慰。”

Until recently, most of the OSS foundations were California-based
organizations. However, as open source becomes increasingly global,
many ecosystem leaders concede that the present and future gov-
ernance of open source communities can't be located solely in
California. "Sometimes you need specialized expertise or capabilities

to address the needs of a particular vertical or region," said Jim
Zemlin of the Linux Foundation. "For example, the E.U. is working on
technology sovereignty and seeking to harness open source to lessen
the influence of U.S. tech giants. If you want to access E.U. grant
funding to contribute to relevant projects, you need European experts,
and your organization must also be incorporated in the E.U." To that
end, the Linux Foundation launched a European branch

(Linux Foundation Europe) in September 2022 to strengthen its part-
nerships with European constituencies and provide an on-ramp for
European projects and companies seeking to harness open source
solutions in the public and private sectors.23

到如今，大多数OSS基金会都设在了加利福尼亚。然而，随着开源变得越来越全球化，许多生态系统领导者都承认，开源社区目前和未来的治理将不会仅仅局限于加州。Linux基金会的Jim Zemlin表示:“有时你需要特定的专业知识或能力来满足特定垂直领域或地区的需求。”“例如，欧盟正在致力于技术主权，并试图利用开源来削弱美国科技巨头的影响力。如果你在相关项目上希望获得欧盟的资助，那么就需要聘用欧洲专家，你的组织也必须在欧盟国家注册。”鉴于此，Linux基金会于2022年9月成立了欧洲分支机构（Linux基金会欧洲），以加强与欧洲资助者的合作关系，并为寻求在公共和私营部门利用开源解决方案的欧洲项目和公司提供一个窗口。23

In this sense, Milinkovich and Zemlin agree that one could inter- pret
the creation of regional associations as a sign of success rather than
a failure of global collaboration. They point to China, which is on
the record as wanting to be an influential player in open source with
its own associations and projects. "The European Commission may do the
same," said Milinkovich. "These regional associations may be
unsuccessful, but hopefully give rise to a com- petition of ideas."

从这个意义上讲，Milinkovich 与 Zemlin都认为，人们可以把区域性协会的创立看作是全球合作成功的标志，而不是失败的标志。他们以中国为例，中方公开表示希望通过自己的协会和项目成为开源领域具有影响力的参与者。Milinkovich说:“欧盟委员会可能也会效仿。“这些区域性协会不一定会取得成功，但非常有希望引导一场思维的竞赛。”

#### "All stakeholders consulted for the study agree that improved collaboration between open source foundations is required to address the ecosystem's challenges."

#### “参与这项研究的所有利益相关者一致认为，为了应对生态系统的挑战，需要改进开源基金会之间的合作。”

Whatever their feelings on the proliferation of new foundations and
initiatives, all stakeholders consulted for the study agree that
improved collaboration between open source foundations is required to
address the ecosystem's challenges. Indeed, with

modern tools, open source leaders see few excuses for not working
together to address issues of shared concern. "The foundations should
be insisting on open and broad collaboration to limit the duplication
of effort," said Alan Clark of SUSE. "We need to find a way to align
the projects. In fact, the projects themselves need to follow open
source methods. The design and development pro- cesses should be
transparent. The meetings and records should be open. The discussions
and decision-making should be well docu- mented. In other words, the
initiatives that foundations lead should be truly open source
projects," said Clark.

无论对新基金会和新项目的激增抱有什么样的看法，所有参与研究的利益相关者都已经意识到，为了应对生态系统的挑战，需要改进开源基金会之间的合作。事实上，通过使用现代化工具，开源领袖们几乎没有了不想通过合作方式来解决共同关心问题的借口。SUSE的Alan Clark认为：“各个基金会应当坚持开放和广泛的合作，以规避重复工作。”“我们需要找到一种方法来协调这些项目。事实上，项目本身需要遵循开源方法。设计和开发过程应该是透明的。会议和记录要予以公开。讨论和决策应该有很好的文件记录。换句话说，基金会领导的项目应该是真正的开源项目。”

Mike Dolan of the Linux Foundation also sees an opportunity for larger
open source foundations to provide an umbrella for

smaller projects, reducing overlap and economizing on overhead and
other resources. "We might launch five projects in a quarter. GitHub
is launching 5,000 new projects a day," said Dolan. The challenge is
that each has a unique set of stakeholders who

want a neutral, growing project that enables new cost savings or
market opportunities---and they want to work on them together.
Foundations enable them to work together in a structured way. Dolan
argues that it is difficult in many instances to curtail the creation
of new projects. However, he sees a role for foundations in helping to
align efforts and streamline operations. "This innova- tion is
happening with or without us," said Dolan, "so what we're trying to do
is to concentrate on a few projects that matter and provide an
umbrella structure for projects with shared objectives to come
together."

Linux基金会的Mike Dolan也分析了大型开源基金会为小型项目提供护佑的机遇：减少重叠，节约开销和其他资源。“我们可能会在一个季度推出五个项目。GitHub每天推出5000个新项目，”Dolan这样说。其中的挑战在于，每个公司都有一组独特的利益相关者，他们想要一个中立的、持续发展的项目，以实现新的成本节约或市场机会——他们想共同奋斗。基金会使他们能够以一种结构化的方式并肩协作。Dolan认为，在许多情况下，限制新项目的创建是很困难的。不过，他看到了基金会在帮助协调各方努力和简化运营方面的作用。Dolan表示：“不管有没有我们，这种创新都会发生，所以我们正在努力做的是专注于几个重要的项目，并为有共同目标的项目提供一个保护框架。”

 Maintaining critical open source infrastructure
-----------------------------------------------

关键开源基础设施维护
-----------------------------------------------

One area urgently calling for increased collaboration is securing and
safeguarding the vast patchwork of critical open source com- ponents.
Decentralized innovation has produced a remarkable tapestry of open
source components, and their deployment have widely supported the
digital economy. However, maintaining

the disparate components is a complex challenge that requires a
transparent and coordinated approach and more significant funding and
resources from organizations that draw value from open source
infrastructure.

如果说哪个领域迫切需要加强合作，那无疑是海量关键开源组件的安全和保护。大量的开源组件在去中心化创新的过程中产生，它们的部署已经对数字经济提供了广泛支持。然而，对不同组件的维护也是一项复杂的挑战，需要采取透明和同步的方式，并向那些在开源基础设施中获益组织申请更多的资金和资源。

Cybercriminals and other malevolent networks are ramping up their
attacks, making cybersecurity essential to safeguarding the global
economy and defending critical infrastructure. As a result, industries
and governments have invested considerable sums

in correcting the frequent security issues plaguing proprietary
software. However, the recent Log4Shell software vulnerabili- ties
highlight the need for a commensurate effort to protect open source
tools, which are just as critical and often more ubiquitous than their
proprietary counterparts.

网络犯罪分子和其他恶意网络行为正在不断加大攻击力度，网络安全对于保护全球经济和保护关键基础设施变得至关重要。因此，行业和政府都投入了大量资金来治理那些频发的困扰专有软件的安全问题。然而，最近的Log4Shell软件漏洞突出表明，开源工具的保护也需要付出相应的努力，这些工具与专有工具一样重要，而且往往更普及。

Open source components are embedded in numerous pieces of critical
infrastructure that provide the underpinnings for global commerce,
from power grids, shipping, and transportation to electronic commerce
and finance. Understanding which compo- nents are most widely used and
most vulnerable to exploitation is crucial for the continued health of
the open source ecosystem

and the broader digital economy. As Jim Zemlin, executive director of
the Linux Foundation, explains, "Hundreds of thousands of OSS packages
are in production applications throughout the supply chain.
Understanding what we need to be assessing for vulnera- bilities is
the first step for ensuring long-term security and sus- tainability of
OSS."24 However, as the Laboratory for Innovation Science at Harvard
points out, "it is difficult to fully understand the health and
security of OSS because 1) OSS, by design, is distrib- uted in nature,
so there is no central authority to ensure quality

![](media/image66.png)

and maintenance, and 2) because OSS can be freely copied and modified,
it is unclear how much OSS, and precisely what types of OSS, are most
widely used."25

许多关键基础设施中都嵌入了碎片化开源组件，这些基础设施为全球商业提供的基础服务从电网、物流和交通直到电子商务和金融。了解哪些组件使用最广泛、最容易被利用，对于开源生态系统和更广泛数字经济的持续健康至关重要。正如Linux基金会执行董事Jim Zemlin所阐述的，“在整个供应链中，有数十万个OSS软件包处于应用程序的研发中。明确了解哪些漏洞需要评估，是确保OSS长期安全和可持续发展的首要任务。”24 然而，正如哈佛大学创新科学实验室所持的态度，“很难完全了解开源软件的健康和安全程度，因为：（1）从设计上讲，开源软件本质上是分布式的，没有一个权威中枢对其质量和维护进行保证；![](media/image66.png)（2）因为开源软件可以自由复制和修改，目前尚不清楚有多少开源软件，或者更确切地说，哪种类型的开源软件被广泛使用。”25

Tracking the proliferation of OSS and monitoring potential vulnera-
bilities are complex tasks. Just as vexing, however, is the challenge
of maintaining the vast number of critical OSS components in use
today. As Kent Walker, Alphabet's president of global affairs, points
out, "\[In most cases\] there's no official resource allocation and
few formal requirements or standards for maintaining the security of
critical open source code."26 While high-profile projects, such as
Linux, have active communities and receive regular attention, other
projects are infrequently updated and have few watchers.

跟踪OSS的增长和监测潜在的漏洞是一项复杂的任务。然而同样令人烦恼的，是当下大量关键OSS组件投入使用的挑战。正如Alphabet的全球事务总裁Kent Walker所指出的一样，“在大多数情况下，没有官方的资源分配，很少有正式的规范或标准来保证关键开源代码的安全性。”26“尽管Linux等高调的项目有活跃的社区并时刻被关注，但其他项目却不能经常更新，也很少有人注意。”

"Open source infrastructure is the classic small pieces, loosely
joined with lots of independent components developed by small
maintainers who are not necessarily compensated for their work," said
Mark Surman. As the ecosystem addresses its sustainabil-

ity challenges, Surman advises, "It is vital to remember that open
source is a tremendous accelerator of innovation and the digital
economy. It's not realistic to consolidate it all. So how can we
ensure longevity? Are there ways to compensate those maintain- ers?
Could we have a Patreon for open source components?"

Mark Surman认为：“开源基础设施是典型碎片化，众多由小规模维护人员开发的独立组件被连接在一起，而这些维护人员的工作不一定会享受报酬。”在生态系统应对可持续性发展挑战的问题上，他建议到：“一定要牢记，开源是创新和数字经济的巨大加速器。全部加固是不现实的。那么，我们如何才能青春永驻呢?有补偿这些维护者的办法吗？我们也可以拥有一个Patreon来支持开源组件吗?”

In the absence of a distributed compensation and resourcing model,
organizations such as the newly created Open Source Security
Foundation (OpenSSF) will play a vital role in identifying critical
com- ponents, assessing vulnerabilities, and establishing new commu-
nity-based processes and standards for regular maintenance and
testing. "The OpenSSF is an industry effort with a roving SWAT team,"
said Jim Zemlin. "They will identify the abandoned projects and then
shore them up. The scorecard and SLSA frameworks we are working on are
key to this. We can use these frameworks to identify the vulnerable
components, including all the dependencies in the ecosystem, and then
target resources to those unsupported or under-resourced areas."

在分散补偿和资源分配模型不足的情况下，一些像开源安全基金会（OpenSSF）之类新兴组织将在识别关键组件、评估漏洞和新建基于社区的定期维护和测试过程和标准等方面发挥至关重要的作用。 Jim Zemlin认为：“OpenSSF是一整个行业努力的成果，它拥有一个流动的SWAT小组。”“他们识别出一些即将中止的项目，然后予以支持。我们正在开发的记分卡和SLSA框架是其中的关键。我们可以使用这些框架来识别脆弱的组件，包括生态系统中所有的依赖项，然后让资源向到那些不受支持或资源不足的领域倾斜。”

#### "Many leaders consulted for the study would also like to see large enterprises and other significant beneficiaries pitching in to help sustain a thriving open source ecosystem."

#### “为这项研究提供咨询的许多领导者也希望大型企业和其他显著受益者参与其中，助力维持一个蓬勃发展的开源生态系统。”

In 2022, DARPA, the U.S. military's research arm, weighed in on the
matter with a multi-million-dollar effort, over 18 months, to help
identify malicious actors and prevent them from corrupting critical
open source infrastructure. DARPA notes that much of the U.S.
Department of Defense's computing infrastructure rests on a foun-
dation of OSS. DARPA's so-called "Social Cyber" program will harness
AI "to detect and counteract any malicious campaigns to submit flawed
code, launch influence operations, sabotage development, or even take
control of open-source projects." Part of the effort involves scouring
through millions of lines of code to detect vulnerabilities.

DARPA will also analyze social interactions on mailing lists and other
forums to gain insight into the community of software developers who
write, fix, implement, and influence that code. DARPA hopes that
sentiment analysis deployed at scale will allow researchers to
identify trustworthy contributors and the individuals and groups that
justify extra vigilance.27 However, the countereffect is that devel-
opers and open source advocates see any government monitoring as
potentially harmful and intrusive. Programs like this could lead

to backlash from the same project communities that governments intend
to support.

2022年，美国军方研究机构DARPA耗时18个月、耗资数百万美元，对恶意行为的识别工作进行支持，并阻止其破坏关键开源基础设施。DARPA指出，美国国防部的大部分计算基础设施都基于OSS。DARPA所谓的“社交网络”项目将利用人工智能“检测和抵消各种恶意行为，诸如提交有缺陷的代码，发起影响行动，破坏开发，甚至控制开源项目。”这些工作中有一部分就包括在数百万行代码中检测漏洞。DARPA还将分析邮件列表和其他论坛上的社交互动，以深入了解编写、修复、实现和影响代码的软件开发社区。DARPA希望大规模部署的情绪分析可以帮助研究人员识别可信的贡献者，以及需要加以警惕的个人和团体27。然而事与愿违，开发人员和开源倡导者都认为任何政府监控都带有潜在的危害性和入侵性。这种项目可能会在政府计划支持的项目社区中引起反弹。

Stormy Peters says GitHub is also trying to make it easier for devel-
opers to make their software more secure by providing a free and open
database of vulnerability information and enabling private vul-
nerability reporting. However, many leaders consulted for the study
would also like to see large enterprises and other significant benefi-
ciaries pitching in to help sustain a thriving open source ecosystem.

Stormy Peters表示，GitHub还试图通过提供免费开放的漏洞信息数据库和授权定制漏洞报告，让开发人员更容易提高软件安全性能。然而，为该研究提供咨询的许多领导者也希望看到大型企业和其他重要受益者参与进来，共同为开源生态系统的蓬勃发展提供帮助。

"Technology consumers, especially the enterprises, have had a free
ride for far too long," said Mike Milinkovich of Eclipse. "Some
vendors include open source components in the products they use, yet
enterprises rarely give anything back to the communities

they rely upon for their application development. The sustainabil- ity
problems are related to the lack of money and resources to do all the
things that must be done." Peters agrees that the absence of funding
for small project maintainers is a problem and notes that GitHub is
also working on tools to help companies contribute finan- cial
resources to maintaining critical infrastructure components.

Eclipse的Mike Milinkovich认为：“消费型科技，尤其是在企业中，搭了太长时间的便车。”“一些供应商在产品中包含开源组件，但很少向他们所依赖的应用程序开发社区提供任何回馈。可持续发展问题与缺乏资金、资源去处理那些必要的事情息息相关。”Peters也认可小型项目维护者缺乏资金已经成为问题，并指出GitHub也在致力于开发一些工具，帮助企业贡献经费资源来维护关键基础设施组件。

Milinkovich, Zemlin, Peters, and others claim that software vendors
and enterprise users have received the memo that they need to engage
in the communities from which they are drawing benefits. "It is time
to recalibrate their engagement in light of where they get the code
and what they need to do to ensure the code is properly main- tained
and sustainable," said Milinkovich. "In the end, there is no free
lunch." Zemlin points to Google (one of Alphabet's subsidiaries) as
one of several good enterprise stewards that have stepped up to help
make code libraries bulletproof.

Milinkovich、Zemlin、Peters等人声称，软件供应商和企业用户已经收到了一份备忘录，他们需要参与社区活动，以便从中获益。Milinkovich说:“这是一个恰当的时机，可以根据他们获得代码的渠道、采取何种措施来确保代码得到适当维护和可持续发展，来重新调整他们的参与程度。”“总之，天下没有免费的午餐。”Zemlin指出，谷歌（Alphabet的子公司之一）是几个优秀的企业管理者之一，他们已经开始帮助强化代码库。

In 2020, for example, more than 10% of Alphabet's full-time employ-
ees (approximately 15,000) actively contributed to open source
projects.28 In addition to managing its own open source code repos-
itories, Alphabet employees contribute to a vast pool of external
projects and actively participate in boosting the security and sus-
tainability of open source and its supply chain. In a significant sign
of progress, hundreds of prominent enterprise and consumer tech-
nology firms, ranging from Amazon to VMware, have established OSPOs
and dedicate comparable proportions of their workforce to developing
and maintaining open source projects.29

例如，在2020年，超过10%的Alphabet全职员工（约15，000人）积极地为开源项目做出贡献。除了管理自己的开源代码库外，Alphabet的员工在大量的外部项目中做出了贡献，并积极参与提高开源及其供应链的安全性和可持续性。从亚马逊到VMware，数百家著名的企业和消费科技公司已经建立了OSPOs，并将相当比例的人力用于开发和维护开源项目，这是一个显著的进步现象。29

Ultimately, Zemlin and others would prefer that the ecosystem address
the sustainability challenge publicly, transparently, and
collaboratively. "The complexity of the modern supply chain is such
that we need a transparent and coordinated approach," said Zemlin. "We
need coordinated disclosure of potential vulnerabili- ties. We need
free training for maintainers of critical projects. We need regular
auditing of specific projects. And in some cases, we need to augment
the talent pool available to do the heavy lifting on maintaining
critical components."

从源头上，Zemlin等人都更希望生态系统能够公开、透明、合作地应对可持续性挑战。Zemlin说:“现代供应链非常复杂，我们需要一种透明和协作的方法。”“我们需要协调一致地披露潜在的漏洞。我们需要为关键项目的维护人员提供免费培训。我们需要对具体项目进行定期审计。有的时候，我们还需要扩充可用的人才库，以完成维护关键组件的繁重工作。”

[]{#_bookmark20 .anchor}With so much at stake, Rod Beckstrom
crystallizes the sense of urgency to act. "Global reliability is key,"
said Beckstrom, who spent much of his time as CEO of ICANN and
director of the National Cybersecurity Center wrestling with the
thorny issues of Internet governance and cybersecurity. "The market
has to step in. Operation Global Blackout from Anonymous was a
credible threat. The system is vulnerable, and we need to look closely
at the central points of failure. That said, I don't worry too much
about the open source systems. The ecosystem is rife with shep- herds
and custodians. Open source has added tremendous value to human life.
Some people will try to break it. Those efforts will likely fail.
Bottom-up will win."

[]{#_bookmark20 .anchor}时不我待，Rod Beckstrom深知形势已经迫在眉睫。Beckstro在担任ICANN首席执行官和国家网络安全中心主任期间，耗费大量时间解决互联网治理和网络安全的棘手问题。他呼吁道：“关键是全球化可靠性。” “市场必须介入。来自匿名者的全球封锁行动是对可信化的威胁。这个系统是脆弱的，我们需要密切关注故障的中心点。实际上，我不太担心开源系统。生态系统中到处都是牧羊人和监护人。开源为人们生活带来巨大的价值。有人试图打破它，而这些努力很可能会失败。自下而上才能笑到最后。”

Increasing collaboration on technology policy and regulation

强化在科技政策和监管方面的合作
------------------------------------------------------------

#### "The foundations would be much stronger if they worked together." **- ALAN CLARKE**

#### “如果他们齐心协力，基础会更加牢固。” **——ALAN CLARKE**

![](media/image68.png)

Beyond cybersecurity, open source leaders consulted for the study
point to a host of other Internet policy issues on which they argue
there could be improved collaboration. For example, in critical
matters such as intellectual property, privacy, and anti- trust, there
is a widely shared view that the open source commu- nity has not been
as influential or assertive in technology policy dialogues as it
should.

![](media/image68.png)
除了网络安全之外，为这项研究提供咨询的开源领导者还指出了许多其他互联网政策问题，他们认为在这些问题上可以改善合作方式。例如，在知识产权、隐私和反垄断等关键问题上，人们普遍认为，开源社区在技术政策对话中没有发挥应有的影响力或判断力。

"Educating politicians can be an uphill battle," said Rod Beckstrom.
"They don't always understand the complexities and nuances of Internet
infrastructure and the related policy issues. But there is no shortage
of critical policy issues where the open source view is needed,
including patent issues, privacy, cybersecurity, antitrust, and
beneficial AI."

Rod Beckstrom称：“对政治家进行教育可能会是一场艰苦的战斗。”“他们并不总是理解互联网基础设施和相关政策问题的复杂性和细微差别。但在关键的政策问题上，也不缺乏开源观点，包括专利问题、隐私、网络安全、反垄断和有益的人工智能。”

The absence of a coordinated open source response to such issues has
left the playing field open to domination by larger,

better-resourced entities. "The big tech players with deep pockets and
teams of lobbyists have tended to dominate the policy and regulatory
conversations," said Alan Clark of SUSE. Clark says the open source
community has been reactive rather than active on most policy issues.
He and others would like to see open source foundations come together
to propose new policies around security, transparency, privacy, and
other pertinent matters. "The foundations would be much stronger if
they worked together," said Clark. "The open source point of view is
especially relevant today. We need an open source approach to solving
global problems."

对上述问题缺乏配套的开源响应，导致竞争环境被规模更大、资源更好的实体所统治。SUSE的Alan Clark表示：“拥有雄厚财力和游说团队的大型科技公司往往主导着政策和监管对话。”Clark说，开源社区在大多数政策问题上一直处于被动位置而非主动。他和其他人希望看到开源基金会联合起来，围绕安全、透明、隐私和其他相关问题提出新的政策。Clark认为：“如果大家合作起来，基础会更加牢固。”“开源的观点在今天尤为重要。我们需要一种开源的方法来解决全球性问题。”

Mike Milinkovich of Eclipse calls the relative absence of open source
foundations in crucial policy debates a "sin of omission." "We are not
a set of stakeholders that policymakers and politicians are accustomed
to dealing with." However, Milinkovich also concedes

that the current state of collaboration among open source foun-
dations is "abysmal and almost non-existent." "Just looking after our
own communities is hard enough," said Milinkovich. "Engaging with our
peers is difficult. We don't have a good venue to do it. We also
compete for members and projects. The bottom line is that we need to
grow up and collaborate."

Eclipse的Mike Milinkovich称，在关键政策辩论过程中，开源基金会的相对缺席是一种“疏忽之罪”。“我们不政策制定者和政治家习惯于打交道的那种利益相关者。”然而，Milinkovich也承认，目前开源基金会之间的合作状态“糟糕透顶，几乎没有”。Milinkovich说：“光是照料我们自己的社区就已经很难了。”“与同行交流很困难。我们没有一个合适的地点。我们还竞争会员和项目。唯独底线是需要成长和合作。”

Jim Zemlin agrees that the foundations don't have a stellar track
record of collaboration. However, he points out that open source is on
the radar in the wake of the Log4Shell vulnerabilities. "Going
forward, we have an opportunity to be much more influential in guiding
the evolution of the Internet," said Zemlin. Mike Dolan adds that much
of the behind-the-scenes work the Linux Foundation does may not be
visible because it is not set up or resourced to

be a full-time government education organization. "We do not have
government education staff sitting full time in Washington, or
Brussels, or Beijing, or Tokyo," said Dolan, "but we are here to
protect the ability of open source communities to collaborate and
thrive. We channel our members, brands, and capabilities into those
efforts. I think it's been quite effective. Open source com- munities
have been active since 1990, and, in that time, there has been no
policy that killed open source. The reality is that we have big
defenders. Microsoft, IBM, Red Hat, Google, Oracle, Intel, and others
are equipped to stand up to the U.S. government if they try to do
something that threatens the open source collaboration underpinning
multi-billion dollar businesses they can't just walk away from."

Jim Zemlin也认为，这些基金会在合作方面没有出彩的历史。然而，他同时指出，随着Log4Shell漏洞的出现，开源正在受到关注。Zemlin说：“展望未来，我们有机会在引导互联网发展方面发挥更大的影响力。”Mike Dolan补充到，Linux基金会所做的许多幕后工作可能不为人所知，因为它不是一个全职的政府教育组织。“我们没有在华盛顿、布鲁塞尔、北京或东京从事全职工作的政府教育人员，”Dolan说，“但我们在这里是为了保护开源社区合作和繁荣发展的能力。我们将会员、品牌和能力输送到这些努力之中。我认为这很有效。开源社区自1990年以来一直很活跃，并且从那时起，没有任何政策会扼杀开源。实际上我们有强大的守护者。微软、IBM、红帽、谷歌、甲骨文、英特尔和其他公司都有能力对抗美国政府，如果政府试图做一些事情，威胁到支持数十亿美元业务的开源合作，这些企业就不能坐视不管。”

Beckstrom argues that the open source community could increase its
policy influence through lightweight coordination. "Convene a regular
meeting circle of top foundation leaders," said Beckstrom. "Create a
dialogue among the leaders, and identify the shared issues on which
the ecosystem could collectively assert its voice. Then create a
circle of the chief legal counsels. There could be a benefit from
further collaboration between the policy leads."

Astor Nummelin Carlberg of OpenForum Europe notes that there are
challenges on the governmental side as well. "In Europe,

we work with the European Commission around issues ranging from
product safety to cybersecurity to privacy," said Carlberg. "However,
many policies and regulations in those domains are still driven by
national bodies. It requires a lot of resources and staffing to
participate in policy deliberations across so many individual
nation-states." Carlberg argues that creating OSPOs at the national
level could provide an interface for discussions around policy and
regulation and notes that France has built one and Germany is

in the process of doing so. "We won't have a coherent voice if we work
company-by-company and foundation-by-foundation."

Beckstrom认为，开源社区可以通过轻量级协调来增加其政策影响力。Beckstrom说：“召集顶级基金会领导人定期开会。”“在领导人之间建立对话，并确定生态系统可以集体发声的共同议题。然后建立一个由首席法律顾问组成的圈子。政策领导者之间的进一步合作可能会带来好处。”欧洲开放论坛的Astor Nummelin Carlberg指出，政府方面也存在挑战。Carlberg说：“在欧洲，我们与欧盟委员会就产品安全、网络安全和隐私等问题展开合作。”“然而，这些领域的许多政策和法规仍然由各国机构推动。参与这么多独立民族国家的政策审议需要大量的资源和人员。”Carlberg认为，在国家层面建立OSPOs可以为讨论政策和监管提供一个界面，并指出法国已经建立完成，德国正在开展这项工作。“如果一个公司一个公司的行动，一个基金会一个基金会的行动，我们就不会有一致的声音。”

More broadly, there is a global opportunity for the OSS community to
position itself as a rich source of solutions for public policy
issues. "The biggest frontier for open source is in the public
sphere," said Gabriele Columbro of FINOS and Linux Foundation Europe.
"The Linux Foundation has perfected its governance models for enabling
collaboration with corporations and individuals. We need a similar
model and pattern of engagement with the public sector." Columbro
points to digital public services, healthcare, education, and climate
change as significant opportunity spaces for open source solutions.
"We need a repeatable and trustable process that achieves public
policy goals through open source innovation."

进一步讲，OSS社区有一个全球化的机会，可以将自己定位成为公共政策问题解决方案的丰富来源。FINOS和Linux欧洲基金会的Gabriele Columbro说:“开源最大的前沿是在公共领域。”“Linux基金会已经完善了与公司及个人合作的治理模型。我们需要与公共机构建立类似的合作模式。”Columbro指出，数字公共服务、医疗保健、教育和气候变化是开源解决方案的重要机会领域。”“我们需要一个可重复和可信赖的过程，通过开源创新来实现公共政策目标。”
