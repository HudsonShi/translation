Promoting Global Inclusion
==========================

Once firmly rooted in the United States, today's open source community
is increasingly global and cosmopolitan. China, for example, has
become a significant consumer of and contributor to open source
technologies. Not only do nearly 90% of Chinese firms use open source
technologies,7 Chinese users are the second most prolific group on
GitHub after users from the United States.8

With China intent on boosting its software prowess, Chinese par-
ticipation in open source will increase dramatically in the years
ahead. China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT)
has expressed concerns about its domestic software indus- try's
international competitiveness and sees deeper participation in
international open source projects as a means to place itself on an
equal footing with global players.9 Among the plans to improve the
state of homegrown software, the MIIT is investing in a series of
software parks, implementing additional policy supports, and creating
two or three open source foundations or communities to bolster China's
international influence.

#### "A global open collaboration orchestrated by an effective foundation is arguably the best way to reduce fragmentation and promote international cooperation."

Chinese technology leaders have already initiated and championed
several prominent open source projects. Alibaba, for example,

has one of China's most robust open source talent pools. An active
participant in RISC-V, the global open source semiconduc- tor
community, the e-commerce giant recently took the bold step of open
sourcing its semiconductor design development via the OpenXuantie
project.10 In another example, Baidu launched Apollo in 2017, which
has since evolved into one of the world's leading open source
solutions for autonomous vehicles.11 Baidu is lever- aging driverless
technology in its Apollo Go robotaxi service. The

autonomous taxi service currently operates in five Chinese cities, but
the company plans to expand Apollo Go to 65 cities by 2025 and then
100 cities by 2030.12

China is a prominent example of the globalization of OSS. However,
many emerging economies contain large communities of open source
developers, including India, Russia, Korea, and Ukraine. Harvard
Business School researchers Nataliya Langburd Wright, Frank Nagle, and
Shane Greenstein observe in a recent study that "Just like their
counterparts in developed economies, programmers around the globe
employ open source tools, speak the vocabulary of open source, and
interact with open source libraries."13 Engagement with OSS
communities, in turn, is giving rise to new entrepreneurial ventures
and accelerating the pace of economic development. Wright, Nagle, and
Greenstein conclude that "\[OSS\] represents an opportunity for low-
and middle-in- come countries to reach the technological frontier more
quickly than if they needed to develop such software from scratch or
obtain it from costly sources\..."14

Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V, argues that a global open collabo-
ration orchestrated by an effective foundation is arguably the best
way to reduce fragmentation and promote international coopera- tion.
"Collaboration on open standards and software has proven throughout
history that alignment to a shared collective model reduces the
temptation and economic feasibility for ecosystem participants to take
a proprietary approach to common building blocks," said Redmond. "We
are creating a strong foundation with a global community where roughly
one-third of our members are in NA, one-third in AMEA, and one-third
in APAC."

"It's easier to collaborate globally now," said Redmond. "We have the
technology to support globally distributed teams." Redmond points to
growing global participation in RISC-V's technical working

[]{#_bookmark10 .anchor}groups. Today, RISC-V has 65+ working groups.
Redmond said there could be 80 by the end of 2022. "Now we are
starting to ship actual products in a variety of vertical markets,
including automo- tive, industrials, transportation, and aerospace.
It's a remarkable time. We are building a robust ecosystem across
workloads, from embedded to enterprise, and accomplishing in five or
six years what it took earlier microprocessor architectures 20 years
to do."

The barriers to global participation
------------------------------------

#### "The hegemony of North American participants can overshadow open source projects that originated in other parts of the world."

Open source leaders consulted for the study agree that global
participation in open source is on the rise. However, there is also
broad recognition that a failure to eliminate several formidable
barriers to full participation could result in regional fragmenta-
tion in the open source ecosystem. For example, leaders point to
language, culture, and geopolitics as ongoing challenges. There also
remains a prevalent sense that companies and foundations headquartered
in the United States have outsized influence in shaping most open
source projects.

Among the first challenges raised by interviewees is the tech
industry's long history of systemic discrimination, including its
deeply entrenched sexism and its dismal record on diversity and
inclusion. Interviewees suggest that open source communities are not
immune to these challenges, despite the community's efforts to address
them. "Some parts of the open source world still feel like old school
'bro' culture," said Mark Surman of the Mozilla Foundation. "That's a
big issue in a world where diversity of thought and experience are key
assets."

Open source leaders fear that a failure to address the open source
community's "bro" culture will curtail its access to talent and inge-
nuity. "The people who don't feel welcomed will build technology

in other ways," said Surman. "Unfortunately, that could mean that the
best talent will build proprietary technology because they don't have
the time and resources to contribute for free."

Ramon Roche, general manager of the DroneCode Foundation, argues that
another cultural barrier to global participation is the lack of
acceptance of open source methods and principles in some regions. "In
Latin America, we still lack validation that open source is a key
component of success and a valid way to produce software," said Roche.
"Managers and decision-makers don't understand how the open source
community works, and develop- ers often fight uphill battles to
contribute to open source efforts."

When Roche started creating open source code for drones 10 years ago
in Mexico, he struggled to find a vibrant open source community
locally and lacked the know-how to build one from scratch. "There was
nowhere to go for support or help," said Roche. "Most of the open
source organizations are based in North America. The estab- lished
tech players like Google, Meta, and Microsoft, and the people that
work there, control what is going on. They lead steering commit- tees
as well. You need to finance your seat or be a maintainer or top
contributor to be visible and influential in the community."

The hegemony of North American participants, in turn, can over- shadow
open source projects that originated in other parts of the world.
"Latin American developers and software startups would like to see
more acknowledgment that we exist," said Roche. "Projects in Latin
America are often overlooked. If you actively look for them, there are
communities and companies across the conti- nent, but they sit outside
the core of the open source community."

Reflecting on the Japanese experience, Noriaki Fukuyasu, VP of Japan
Operations at the Linux Foundation, says the pace of innova- tion is
slower than in North America, and enterprise IT managers are less
comfortable with open source. "We have fewer engineers on the user
side driving innovation," said Fukuyasu. "They prefer what they
perceive to be the more stable, proprietary solutions, and their
reticence to experiment is slowing down transformation."

[]{#_bookmark11 .anchor}Even when Japanese enterprises adopt OSS, they
are less likely to contribute their modifications back into the
upstream code. "They use open source, but they tend to modify
locally," said Fukuyasu. "They rarely apply the new patches, even
though the patches and fixes exist." Fukuyasu attributes the dearth of
engagement to the fact that Japanese enterprises outsource much of
their IT manage- ment to external vendors. "They don't see open source
as a core competence and, as a result, the community of open source
devel- opers is quite small relative to the United States."

For the community of open source developers in Japan, it can take time
to adjust to open source norms. "Culturally, people are not
comfortable showing off their thoughts in public forums, online chats,
and mailing lists," said Fukuyasu. "Language is also a big issue. For
example, delaying the translation of project mate- rials when
launching a new project can significantly slow down adoption by the
Japanese community."

The building blocks for global inclusion
----------------------------------------

#### "The scale of the challenge is much larger now because of growing participation." **- JIM ZEMLIN**

Creating a more equitable balance of power and promoting global
inclusion are critical to the future of open source, especially its
talent pool. So, what can the open source community do to avoid
fragmentation along regional and cultural fault lines? Key sugges-
tions include championing diversity and inclusion, investing in better
translation, fostering professionalism, educating participants about
open source norms, and using in-person events to build trust.

Open source leaders say that policies and practices that foster
diversity and inclusion are vital starting points. "It's not only
about gender," said Alan Clark of SUSE. "Diversity is also about being
aware of the different cultures within our global developer community

and ensuring that community methods are inclusive." Clark says

collaboration is part of the DNA at SUSE and claims that executives
have made efforts to understand and adapt the company's pro- cesses to
the unique cultural dynamics in different regions of the world.
"Diversity is increasingly key to building a strong talent pool. You
can bring in new perspectives and insights. That integration of global
perspectives has made open source more successful."

Jim Zemlin of the Linux Foundation argues that open source projects
should also have DEI requirements but that policies alone are
insufficient. "Having a set of collective cultural norms is key," said
Zemlin. "But the scale of the challenge is much larger now because of
growing participation from around the world." Zemlin points out that
social coding platforms can help identify challenges in integrating
diverse participation by measuring the form and nature of
collaboration. "In 2022, project leaders and open source companies can
measure every digital engagement touchpoint. Are there small voices
and loud voices? Are you successfully onboard- ing new developers? How
long does it take for individuals to con- tribute to discussions
actively?"

Digital engagement data can inform decision-making. Then it's up to
leaders to foster a project ethic and culture that attracts diverse
participants. "What people miss is the aspect of highly skilled
individual leadership," said Zemlin. "You need a technical subject
matter expert with the human qualities to lead. And not just people
but also the companies who are participating. Pulling these diverse
international networks together takes a lot of capability."

An essential task for project leaders is taming the macho "bro"
culture that pervades today's tech world. "We insist on a profes-
sional culture," said Mike Milinkovich of Eclipse. "To increase inclu-
sion, you must focus on professionalism in your dialogue and behavior.
Keeping things professional helps smooth cultural differ- ences around
conflict resolution and project communication."

At the operational level, open source leaders are also address- ing
language translation challenges. English may be the lingua franca of
the software world, but project leaders outside of North

![](media/image60.png)

#### "Rapid translation is the key to fostering greater engagement."

-   **NORIYAKI FUKUYASU**

America insist that translating project communications into native
languages drives broader participation. For example, Ramon Roche of
the DroneCode Foundation claims that translation and language are
genuine barriers in Latin America and has experi- enced the same
challenges in engaging developers from Asia. "Asian communities have
been eager adopters of our open source solutions for drones," said
Roche. "We found that although they were using our software, they were
not contributing very much back. So we hired a bilingual community
manager, and she helped us reach those communities. We translated our
materials into Korean and Chinese and have seen a large influx of new
users." In addition to translating project materials, DroneCode
started using popular messaging tools such as WeChat and then went to
work translating its user interfaces. "Our Chinese membership picked
up significantly once we organized a community to help with the user
interface translation efforts," said Roche. "Companies that used to
clone our work are now active participants."

Manual translation is time-consuming and expensive, so open source
leaders see machine translation as the future. Linux Foundation Japan,
for example, is working with Japanese institutes to implement machine
translation systems that will speed up the translations of project
materials and user interfaces. "Rapid trans- lation is the key to
fostering greater engagement," said Noriaki Fukuyasu. "We are working
on it 24/7. The scale of the translation challenge has exceeded what
can be done by human resources."

Fukuyasu and others also argue that the return of in-person events in
the post-COVID-19 era will expand the person-to-person connec- tions
required to solidify trust in the community. "Japanese people are
generally reluctant to contribute until they have had an oppor- tunity
to meet the people they are working with," said Fukuyasu. He explains
that events build trust by allowing developers to establish a rapport
with project maintainers. "COVID-19 put a hold on our Linux Foundation
gatherings, but we are eager to get that going again to foster those
international connections."

Transcending Techno-Nationalism
===============================

While global participation in open source is increasing dramat-
ically, the rise of techno-nationalism is pulling in the opposite
direction. The competition for national technological superiority is
such that ecosystem leaders worry that geopolitical tensions could
undermine the international collaboration on which the open source
software community depends.

For decades, technology has driven increased interconnectivity and
global commerce. Yet, today, investments in technology and innovation
are becoming inextricably bound up in geopolitical rivalries. In
short, geopolitical rivals are engaged in an increasingly high-stakes
contest to reign supreme in the technological sectors thought likely
to dominate the 21st century, from robotics and arti- ficial
intelligence (AI) to the industrial Internet and advanced tele-
communications networks.

Alex Capri of the National University of Singapore defines tech-
no-nationalism as "a mercantilist behavior that links a nation's tech
capabilities and enterprise with issues of national security, economic
prosperity, and social stability."15 This new brand of

techno-nationalism has seen countries worldwide move to restrict the
transfer of critical innovations beyond national borders, believing
that doing so will spur national economic growth and foster domestic
competitive advantages. As a case in point, Capri cites "the steady
progression of export controls on tangible, hard technology, followed
by restrictions on data access and usage, and, most recently, new
controls ... that will impede the free movement and development of
human capital."

Some public and private sector leaders believe that borderless
technologies will transcend these nationalist tendencies and drive
increased interconnectivity in the years ahead, just as they have in
the two decades prior. For example, at a recent meeting of the World
Economic Forum, Jayraj Nair, chief technology officer of IT

services company Wipro, argued that technology will only acceler- ate
globalization. "As far as technology is concerned, the scaling of AI,
or 5G, or blockchain, any of these technologies will increase the
velocity \[of globalization\]," said Nair. "In fact, the velocity will
only exponentially escalate."16

Other observers are less sanguine and forecast a new era of deglo-
balization due to the increased geopolitical tensions and the rise

of protectionist measures deployed by various nations. In 2019, for
example, Beijing took aim at American technology companies by ordering
its government agencies and public institutions to stop using
foreign-made computers and software. More recently, Washington
broadened the scope of the advanced technologies covered by its export
control regulations to include semiconduc- tors. In addition to
stemming the flow of critical technologies, Washington is also
pursuing a worldwide campaign to block the adoption of 5G wireless
technology developed by Chinese telecom giant Huawei.17 The net effect
of these measures is a decoupling

of strategic rivals from global supply chains, digital platforms, and
knowledge networks.

Will techno-nationalism balkanize open source?
----------------------------------------------

How will techno-nationalism impact collaborative, knowledge-in-
tensive activities such as the creation of OSS? Consultations for this
study revealed a spectrum of opinions. On one end of the spectrum are
those who think that techno-nationalism is fundamentally changing how
global innovation networks operate by inserting political
considerations into otherwise technical decisions about who
participates, on what terms, and to what ends. Several indi- viduals
consulted for the study pointed to concrete examples in which
geopolitical tensions resulted in national or regional silos.

Others see techno-nationalism as more of a looming threat than a real
obstacle to open source collaboration at present. All agreed, however,
that techno-nationalism poses a danger to global cooper- ation and
that open source communities should commit to politi- cal neutrality.

"Code review in OSS is about improving the code quality and building
trust between developers," said Han Xiao, the Berlin-based founder of
Jina AI, a commercial OSS company. "Adding politics

to the code review will hurt both and eventually roll back the open
source movement in China."18 Xiao identified the creation of Gitee, a
state-backed Chinese competitor to the international code repository
platform GitHub, as a clear sign of nationalist

prerogatives trumping the open source community's predilection for
unencumbered global collaboration. Gitee has become a backup plan of
sorts for Chinese organizations concerned the U.S. might someday
change its laws in an attempt to exclude Chinese participants from
open source codebases. That is a highly unlikely scenario, given that
open source is publicly available and that it is impossible to block
any one country's access, but it has factored into backup plans.

#### "Geopolitical conflicts and tensions are fragmenting the open source community around national interests."

Rebecca Arcesati, an analyst at the Mercator Institute for China
Studies, also sees Gitee and similar homegrown Chinese alter- natives
to foreign-owned platforms as part of a broader attempt by the Chinese
government to lessen the country's reliance on American tech giants
and insulate the domestic open source com- munity from risks arising
from geopolitical tensions. Arcesati argues most Chinese developers
don't want to be cut off from global open source networks and are
circumspect about China's direction. "The more Beijing tries to
nationalize open source and create an indigenous ecosystem, the less
eager developers will be

to participate in what they perceive to be government-led open source
projects," said Arcesati.19

Peixin Hou, chief software architect and community director for Open
Source of Huawei, is another of those who see evidence that
geopolitical conflicts and tensions are fragmenting the open source
community around national interests. He says Chinese users and
developers of OSS are concerned that the U.S. government might expand
its trade restrictions into the open source world, which would be
harmful to both sides and eventually undermine collabo- rative
innovation between nations.

Hou and others voiced concerns that forks could emerge in key software
platforms to enable national economies to control aspects of the
technology domestically. And then there is the risk that
techno-nationalism could diminish the global open source talent pool.
"Developers in China have concerns," said Hou. "Will contributors from
certain countries be discriminated against when they participate in
open source projects? Could concerns about national security lead
developers to reduce their participation

if geopolitical tensions escalate further?" Hou worries that tech-
no-nationalism runs the risk of excluding a significant source of
talent and ingenuity. "The trust between developers and open source
communities has traditionally depended upon the contri- butions of
individual developers instead of his or her country of origin or
organizational affiliation, but is this going to change?" asks Hou.

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has also raised alarm
bells for some open source projects. Ramon Roche of the DroneCode
Foundation says the war in Ukraine has changed everything. "Drones are
being widely deployed in the conflict," said Roche, "and that brings
the security and safety of the supply chains into critical focus."
Roche says the U.S. and European coun- tries only want drones
developed by trusted manufacturers. "They also want to ensure that
foreign entities are not embedding mali- cious code in the open source
systems for the drones."

#### ![](media/image62.png)"Europeans see open source as an opportunity to enhance digital autonomy and sovereignty and lessen their dependence on US tech giants."

**- ASTOR NUMMELIN-CARLBERG**

For years, the DroneCode Foundation worked closely with Chinese
developers. As of now, Roche says end users from certain regions can't
use software or hardware developed by Chinese compa- nies. "We want
open collaboration," said Roche. "We don't want to exclude any
developers. They can make valuable contributions, and they can be
totally innocuous. Unfortunately, we also have a big Russian community
that has completely stopped contributing. We don't even talk now. We
had active contributors. We had com- panies doing research and
development in the drone space. They are now completely out of the
loop."

Astor Nummelin Carlberg of OpenForum Europe claims techno-na-
tionalism is also rearing its head in Europe. "The issue of exclud-
ing companies and other participants from standards bodies

and open source projects based on nationality has become quite
contentious," said Carlberg. He notes that there have been cases where
European companies have been unwilling to participate in international
open source projects in which Chinese compa- nies are also present
because of the perceived legal uncertain-

ties and the risk of a policy backlash at home. At the same time, he
sees European policymakers attempting to insert national objec- tives
into open source projects. "Europeans see open source as

an opportunity to enhance digital autonomy and sovereignty and lessen
their dependence on U.S. tech giants," said Carlberg. As a result,
"European countries often push for greater European par- ticipation in
standards bodies, and there are discussions around the creation of
uniquely open source projects and foundations."

Tackling techno-nationalism with transparency and trust
-------------------------------------------------------

Despite widespread concerns, there is considerable confidence among
open source leaders that transparent open source protocols can help
the community transcend techno-nationalist tendencies.

Alan Clark of SUSE says he sees the risks of techno-nationalism. "It's
hard to counter it," he said. "However, the solution is to be open.
You can alleviate many concerns about the subversion of code to
national interests or other agendas by being open and transparent with
your communications and recording all your decisions and how you
arrived at those decisions. We need OSS development to transcend
national interests. Otherwise, we risk real fragmentation."

Chris Aniszczyk, chief technology officer of the Linux Foundation,
notes that mature OSPOs are increasingly helping their organi- zations
navigate project politics and overcome any proclivities toward
techno-nationalism. Aniszczyk argues that OSPOs can help organizations
"understand and navigate project politics, such as maintaining a
neutral stance when multiple influential actors are attempting to
steer a project or illuminating the latent political considerations of
community members." He suggests that "OSPOs can help companies
maintain a neutral posture on techno-nation- alism and bridge
political differences by cultivating personal and working
relationships that transcend national boundaries and political realms.
Increasingly, this value extends to the work of foundations and
nonprofits, as those realms become important neutral spaces in open
source."20

#### "The open source community is a great

stage for track two diplomacy." **- ROD BECKSTROM**

Ramon Roche of the DroneCode Foundation agrees that transpar- ent
protocols are the key to ensuring that open source projects operate
without geopolitical tensions influencing how and when they engage
with talented developers**.** "If your infrastructure is secure, and
you have robust processes for testing and deploying new software, then
you can trust the source code no matter where it comes from," said
Roche.

Rod Beckstrom goes even further, suggesting that open source
communities could provide informal bridges to help reconcile geo-
political tensions. "Look at science and its rapid progression on so
many fronts," said Beckstrom. "The progress continues despite the
politics and the tensions between the U.S. and China." He expects open
source will follow a similar trajectory to other scientific dis-
ciplines. "In fact, the open source community is a great stage for
track two diplomacy," said Beckstrom. "We need to build mutual trust
and respect. Open source collaboration provides an opportu- nity for
informal networking and relationship building."

In the end, open source leaders agree that countries that close off
collaboration at national borders will be less successful than those
that embrace global cooperation and its benefits. "Fragmentation due
to techno-nationalist imperatives is inherently misguided," said Jim
Zemlin. "Policymakers are the ones creating these tensions. Many don't
even realize that they are giving up the good stuff because of a lack
of trust, including faster times to market and the ability to leverage
a much larger developer community."
