## 前言

Starting in the late 1960s as a way to share computer software, open source has become one of the most influential global collaborations representing the collective sum of humanity's knowledge due to its funda- mental values of equal access, community-driven development, transparency, and inclusiveness.

自20世纪60年代末期开始作为共享计算机软件的一种方式，开源已经成为全球最有影响力的协作之一，代表着人类知识的集体总和，因为它具有平等获取、社区驱动的发展、透明度和包容性等基本价值观。

In the recent past, open source has faced numerous challenges regarding security, sustainability, and legal and license compliance. Owing much to their resiliency, open source communities have collectively worked together in each instance to tackle these issues.

最近，开源面临着许多关于安全性、可持续性以及法律和许可证合规性的挑战。由于其韧性，开源社区在每个实例中共同努力解决这些问题。

But there is a newfound concern. Software fragmentation, politicization, weaponization, and techno-nation- alism could negatively impact open source as a collaborative framework and knowledge base for humanity; As such, these could broadly undermine the original spirit of open source innovation.

但是现在有一个新的问题。软件的分裂、政治化、武器化和技术民族主义可能会对开源作为人类协作框架和知识库产生负面影响；因此，这些可能广泛破坏开源创新的原始精神。

This report represents an open source practitioner's view of these challenges through extensive interviews, validating how global communities can work together to navigate complexities so that the open source mission as a global knowledge base and collaboration platform for humanity remains intact.

本报告代表了开源从业者对这些挑战的观点，通过广泛的采访，验证了全球社区如何共同努力解决复杂问题，以确保开源使命作为人类全球知识库和协作平台保持完整。

## Executive Summary

执行摘要

Over two decades, the open source community has grown immensely. In 2000, there were a handful of high-profile open source projects and a small number of companies and organiza- tions to help steer the community's evolution. Today, the global open source ecosystem consists of millions of projects and an equally large and regionally diverse constellation of participants.

在二十多年的时间里，开源社区已经成长为一个庞大的生态系统。在2000年，有几个知名的开源项目和一些公司和组织来帮助引导社区的发展。今天，全球开源生态系统包括数百万个项目和同样庞大和地区多样的参与者。

Growing global participation in open source software (OSS) is a testament to the ecosystem's success. However, the proliferation of open source projects and organizations also raises a vital question: Is fragmentation in the open source community impeding its progress?

开源软件（OSS）全球参与的增长证明了该生态系统的成功。然而，开源项目和组织的增多也引发了一个重要的问题：开源社区中的分裂是否妨碍了其进展？

This report draws on interviews with open source leaders to examine fragmentation in the open source ecosystem and investigate why it occurs, where it is beneficial, where it is problematic, and what key stakeholders are doing to confront the challenges of fragmen- tation. Specifically, the report examines three domains where fragmentation poses challenges: the development of open source solutions, the integration of diverse contributors from various regions of the world, and the governance of open source communi- ties, including the role of foundations in safeguarding critical open source infrastructure.

本报告基于对开源领袖的采访，探讨开源生态系统的分裂，并调查其产生的原因、何时有益、何时有问题，以及主要利益相关者为应对分裂带来的挑战所做的努力。具体而言，该报告研究了三个领域中分裂带来的挑战：开源解决方案的开发、来自世界各地不同贡献者的集成，以及开源社区的治理，包括基金会在保障关键开源基础设施中的作用。

The key findings from the research are as follows:

研究的主要发现如下：

1. **Fragmentation is a double-edged sword**. While open source leaders acknowledge some fragmentation-related challenges in developing open source solutions, they argue that a decen- tralized ecosystem will always have an inherent degree of fragmentation and duplication. Moreover, the freedom to independently modify open source code produces a diversity of approaches to solving problems and generates superior solutions. While fragmentation can sometimes result in an inefficient allocation of resources, open source leaders caution that efforts to reduce fragmentation could stifle competition and innovation. In other words, solving the frag- mentation problem risks killing the open source goose that laid the golden egg.

2. **There is considerable heterogeneity in the software land- scape when it comes to fragmentation**. Ecosystem leaders observe that some domains are highly consolidated, whereas others are highly fragmented. Typically, fragmentation follows a maturity curve, where fragmentation is highest in the early stages of a technology's development and then consolidation increases over time. Examples of consolidated domains include operating systems (Linux), web servers (Apache), and web browsers (Chrome). Fragmented fields include embedded devices, machine learning, and blockchain.

3. **The principal downsides of fragmentation include increased costs and complexity for consumers and vendors of open source solutions**. Several open source leaders argued that the explosion of projects on GitHub signals an abundance of duplication and risks a diffusion of the community's resources. For vendors, the proliferation of competing projects places a more significant burden on their capacity to support customers. However, end users of open source solutions maintain that the proliferation of projects makes it more challenging to identify, test, and deploy suit- able code libraries. Fragmentation can also reduce the open source effect of having a large community collaborate around a shared platform or standard. Finally, the most unhealthy or disruptive forks are those implemented for non-technical
objectives, specifically for techno-nationalist reasons.

4. **Once firmly rooted in the United States and Western Europe, today's open source community is increasingly global and cosmopolitan**. China, for example, is a signifi- cant consumer of and contributor to open source technol- ogies. Not only do nearly 90% of Chinese firms use open source technologies, but Chinese users are also the second most prolific group on GitHub after users from the United States.1 However, China is not alone. Many emerging econo- mies contain large communities of open source developers, including India, Russia, Korea, and Ukraine. For low- and middle-income countries, engagement with open source communities is giving rise to new entrepreneurial ventures and accelerating the pace of economic development.

5. **Language, culture, and geopolitics remain barriers to participation in open source communities**. While open source is flourishing globally, open source project leaders outside of North America point to language, culture, and geopolitics as genuine obstacles to their ability to maximize the participation of talented developers. Although the open source community is increasingly international, several leaders argue that organizations headquartered in the United States have outsized influence in shaping most open source projects. Open source leaders fear that a failure to address diversity and inclusion issues will curtail the open source community's access to talent and ingenuity.

6. **Diversity and inclusion are critical to building a robust open source talent pool**. The challenges of integrating different languages and cultures into open source communities are not new problems, and there is considerable confidence in the ecosystem's capacity to foster global inclusion. However, open source leaders agree that the community can do more to promote global inclusion. For example, interviewees underlined the need to invest in rapid machine translation capabilities for project communications. Leaders also discussed the impor- tance of promoting open source norms, taming the industry's macho "bro" culture, and fostering professionalism in commu- nity dialogues and decision-making.

7. **Techno-nationalism poses a severe threat to open source collaboration**. Over the past decade, the United States and China have introduced increasingly stringent measures to restrict the transfer of critical innovations beyond national borders. Meanwhile, the war between Russia and Ukraine has heightened geopolitical tensions and made the security of technology supply chains a policy imperative. Numerous inter- viewees cited evidence that geopolitical tensions are creating national or regional silos in global innovation communities. Many open source leaders worry that rising protectionist measures could restrict the distribution of open source code and undermine the community's unfettered approach to inter- national collaboration.

8. **Transparent open source development protocols are the best antidote for techno-nationalism**. To counter techno- nationalism, open source communities must alleviate fears that national interests or malicious actors could taint or corrupt open source projects. Ecosystem leaders see reputation frame- works with enhanced peer review and third-party audits as a means to instill trust in the software development process. Interviewees also called for open source foundations and proj- ects to position themselves as impartial actors and neutral homes for collaboration. They argue that establishing neutral, inclusive, and transparent structures for cooperation will not only broaden participation but can also reduce incentives for ecosystem participants to create parallel efforts along national or regional lines.

9. **The creation of new open source projects has seen a commensurate increase in the number of new founda- tions.** One empirical study found over 100 active entities across a wide range of open source projects. Ecosystem leaders say the proliferation of new foundations and initia- tives is leading to a growing sense of engagement over- load and vendor fatigue, with some enterprises choosing to be more selective about how and where they engage. However, as open source becomes increasingly global, many ecosystem leaders welcome the creation of new open source organizations around the world. For example, stakeholders recognize that some regional or sector-based foundations can more effectively cater to the needs of their unique constituents.

10. **Ecosystem leaders want foundations to do more to align open source projects.** Open source foundations are reluctant to play a lead role in identifying and championing winning open source projects, arguing that picking winners is a marketplace function. However, leaders do see a need for better project curation and want foundations and other ecosystem participants to make greater efforts to align projects with similar objectives. To accomplish this, founda- tions need to enlist skilled community managers with the experience and know-how to compel diverse stakeholders to forge alignment around shared goals. Leaders also called for foundations to bring similar projects under a shared umbrella to eliminate duplication, economize on overhead, and reduce so-called "vendor fatigue."

11. **Securing and safeguarding critical open source infra- structure should be a focal point for collaboration.** All ecosystem leaders agree that building trust and confidence in OSS and supporting the ongoing maintenance of critical open source infrastructure are urgent imperatives. Decentralized innovation is producing a remarkable tapestry of open source components that are being widely deployed to support the digital economy. However, leaders observe that maintaining these disparate components is a complex challenge that requires a transparent and coordinated approach and a more significant deployment of funding and resources from the principal beneficiaries of open source infrastructure.

12. **The need for enhanced collaboration extends to a range of Internet governance issues**. Several ecosystem leaders argued that the open source community has not been as influential or assertive in technology policy dialogues as it should be. They maintain that the absence of a coordinated open source response to such issues has left the playing field open to domination by larger, better-resourced entities. Many would like joint efforts to advance open source advo- cacy on Internet governance issues, including cybersecu- rity, intellectual property, privacy, and antitrust. Ecosystem leaders say greater alignment on policy issues among open source foundations would be helpful, along with the creation of open source program offices (OSPOs) in the public sector to facilitate engagement.

1. 碎片化是一把双刃剑。虽然开源领袖们承认开发开源解决方案存在一些与碎片化相关的挑战，但他们认为分散的生态系统总会具有固有程度的碎片化和重复。此外，独立修改开源代码的自由产生了各种解决问题的方法和更优秀的解决方案。尽管碎片化有时可能导致资源分配的低效，但开源领袖们警告说，减少碎片化的努力可能会扼杀竞争和创新。换句话说，解决碎片化问题会冒杀死孵出金蛋的开源鹅的风险。

2. 在软件领域，碎片化的情况千差万别。生态系统领导者观察到，有些领域高度集中，而有些则高度分散。通常，碎片化遵循成熟度曲线，即技术发展的早期阶段碎片化最高，然后随着时间的推移，集中度会增加。集中的领域包括操作系统（Linux）、Web 服务器（Apache）和 Web 浏览器（Chrome）。分散的领域包括嵌入式设备、机器学习和区块链。

3. 碎片化的主要缺点是增加了开源解决方案的消费者和供应商的成本和复杂性。几位开源领袖认为，GitHub 上项目的爆炸式增长标志着资源的过度复制和社区的扩散风险。对于供应商而言，竞争项目的繁多会对其支持客户的能力造成更大的负担。然而，开源解决方案的最终用户认为，项目的增多使得确定、测试和部署合适的代码库更加困难。碎片化也可能降低开源社区围绕共享平台或标准进行大规模协作的效果。最后，实现非技术目标的分支，特别是为技术民族主义原因而实现的分支，是最不健康或具有破坏性的分支。

4. 如今的开源社区已越来越全球化和国际化，而不再是早期在美国和西欧扎根的社区。例如，中国是开源技术的重要消费者和贡献者。几乎90%的中国公司使用开源技术，而中国用户也是继美国之后GitHub上贡献最多的用户。然而，中国并不是唯一的例子，许多新兴经济体都有庞大的开源开发者社区，包括印度、俄罗斯、韩国和乌克兰。对于低收入和中等收入国家来说，与开源社区的接触正在催生新的企业家精神，并加速经济发展的步伐。

5. 语言、文化和地缘政治仍然是参与开源社区的障碍。虽然开源技术在全球范围内蓬勃发展，但北美以外的开源项目领导者指出语言、文化和地缘政治确实是影响他们最大化吸引才华横溢的开发者参与的障碍。虽然开源社区越来越国际化，但一些领导者认为总部位于美国的组织在塑造大多数开源项目方面具有不可忽视的影响力。开源领导者担心，如果不能解决多样性和包容性问题，将会限制开源社区获取人才和创新的能力。

6. 多样性和包容性对于建立强大的开源人才库至关重要。将不同语言和文化融入开源社区的挑战并不是新问题，生态系统有很大信心能够促进全球包容性。然而，开源领导者认为社区可以采取更多措施促进全球包容性。例如，受访者强调需要投资快速机器翻译能力，以进行项目通信。领导者还讨论了在社区对话和决策中促进开源规范、遏制该行业的男性文化，并培养专业素养的重要性。

7. 技术民族主义对开源合作构成严重威胁。过去十年，美国和中国引入了越来越严格的措施，以限制关键创新技术的跨国转移。与此同时，俄罗斯和乌克兰之间的战争加剧了地缘政治紧张局势，并使技术供应链的安全成为政策必须。许多受访者引用证据表明，地缘政治紧张局势正在在全球创新社区中创造国家或地区的信息孤岛。许多开源领袖担心，日益保护主义的措施可能会限制开源代码的分发，并破坏社区对国际合作的无拘束态度。

8. 透明的开源开发协议是技术民族主义的最佳解药。为了对抗技术民族主义，开源社区必须缓解人们对于国家利益或恶意行为可能玷污或破坏开源项目的担忧。生态系统领袖认为，通过增强同行评审和第三方审计的声誉框架可以建立对软件开发过程的信任。受访者还呼吁开源基金会和项目定位为公正的参与者和协作的中立家园。他们认为，建立中立、包容和透明的合作结构不仅可以扩大参与范围，还可以减少生态系统参与者在国家或地区范围内创建并行努力的动机。

9. 新开源项目的创立使得新基金会的数量相应增加。一项实证研究发现，有100多个活跃的实体涵盖了广泛的开源项目。生态系统领袖表示，新基金会和新举措的不断增加正在导致日益增加的参与负担和供应商疲劳，一些企业选择更加谨慎地选择他们参与的方式和位置。然而，随着开源变得越来越全球化，许多生态系统领袖欢迎在世界各地创建新的开源组织。例如，利益相关者认识到，一些地区或行业基础的基金会可以更有效地满足其独特的成员需求。

10. 生态系统领袖希望基金会在协调开源项目方面发挥更大的作用。 开源基金会不愿意在识别和支持优胜劣汰的开源项目方面发挥领导作用，他们认为选择胜者是市场功能。然而，领袖们认为需要更好的项目策划，希望基金会和其他生态系统参与者更加努力地将项目与相似的目标对齐。为此，基金会需要招募有经验和知识的熟练社区经理人，促使不同的利益相关者围绕共同目标形成对齐。领袖们还呼吁基金会将类似的项目纳入共享伞下，以消除重复，节省开支，并减少所谓的“供应商疲劳”。

11. 保护和维护关键的开源基础设施应该是合作的重点。 所有生态系统领袖都认为，建立对开源软件的信任和信心，支持关键开源基础设施的持续维护是紧迫的任务。分散的创新正在产生一个非常广泛的开源组件网络，这些组件被广泛地部署以支持数字经济。然而，领袖们观察到，维护这些不同的组件是一个复杂的挑战，需要透明和协调的方法，以及来自开源基础设施的主要受益者的更大的资金和资源的投入。

12. 需要增强的协作范围包括一系列互联网治理问题。 几位生态系统领袖认为，开源社区在技术政策对话中的影响力或主张力还不够强。他们认为缺乏一个协调的开源响应机制使得更大、更有资源的实体主导了这个领域。许多人希望共同努力推进开源在互联网治理问题上的倡导，包括网络安全、知识产权、隐私和反垄断等问题。生态系统领袖表示，在开源基金会之间加强政策问题的对齐，以及在公共部门设立开源计划办公室（OSPOs）以促进参与，将会有所帮助。
