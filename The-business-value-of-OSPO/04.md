## The reasons behind starting an OSPO
## 启动 OSPO 项目的理由与动机

As we look at the value that an OSPO provides, there are
two distinct phases. The first phase is the reason behind the OSPO’s creation. The second phase relates to the value that the organization sees as the OSPO matures. In this section, we will address the reasons organizations had for starting the OSPO in the first place and address how the value evolves in a later section. In nearly all cases, there were multiple reasons for starting an OSPO, just as there are multiple reasons for maintaining and expanding the OSPO as it matures. While there can be educational and
social reasons for starting and maintaining an OSPO, this report focuses primarily on the business-related reasons behind having an OSPO, as we have focused the research primarily on for-profit organizations.

我们可以从两个不同的阶段，来审视OSPO所带来的价值，第一阶段是成立OSPO项目的原因，第二阶段是在OSPO成熟时，企业所看到的价值。在本节中，我们将首先讨论组织机构启动OSPO的原因，并在后面的部分中讨论价值如何演变。在多数情况下，启动OSPO的原因很复杂，正如随着OSPO成熟时，维持和扩展OSPO有多种原因一样。虽然启动和维护OSPO项目可能有教育和社会的原因，但本报告主要关注拥有OSPO项目背后的商业相关因素，因为我们的研究主要集中在营利性组织上。

### Compliance
### 合规性

The most fundamental reason that organizations start an OSPO is because they are aware that their engineers are using open source, but they don’t know if they’re complying with the projects’ licenses. “Open source is unavoidable,” said Cornelius Schumacher, open source steward at DB Systel, the digital partner of Deutsche Bahn.
** “Open source is unavoidable”**
Given this reality, DB Systel needed to make an organized, centralized effort to ensure that the company complied with open source license requirements as well as managed potential security issues. “Risk management was not the only reason [for creating the OSPO], but certainly an important part of the decision,” he said.
Because new open source projects are being downloaded and used every day, especially in a large organization, the OSPO’s role is less about conducting a compliance audit and more about putting technology and processes in place to ensure developers are aware of which licenses are or are not acceptable so that it’s easier to conduct compliance audits when necessary.

组织启动OSPO的最根本原因，是因为他们知道自己的工程师正在使用开源，但不确定他们是否遵守了项目的许可规则。 “开源是不可避免的，”德国铁路（Deutsche Bahn）数字合作伙伴DB Systel的开源项目管理员Cornelius Schumacher说。鉴于** “开源是不可避免的”** 这一事实，DB Systel需要进行有组织的集中努力，以确保公司遵守开源许可要求，并管理潜在的安全问题。 “风险管理不是（创建 OSPO）的唯一原因，但肯定是决策的重要组成部分，”他说。 由于每天都有下载和使用新的开源项目，特别是在大型组织中，OSPO的作用与其说是进行合规性审查，不如说是实施技术和流程，以确保开发人员了解哪些许可证可以接受，哪些不可接受，以便在必要时更容易进行合规审查。

### Building standardized processes around open source
### 围绕开源构建标准化流程

Related to the compliance issue, there was often also a need to move from an ad hoc way of using open source projects to a more standardized process. “Right now we have too much sprawl across our open source dependencies,” Ploug said. Part of the rationale for creating the OSPO was to streamline those dependencies to avoid having multiple projects that accomplish the same things.

与合规性问题相关，通常还需要从使用开源项目的临时方式转变为更标准化的流程。Ploug说：“现在我们的开源项目依赖规模过于庞大。” 创建OSPO的一部分原因是要简化这些依赖关系，以避免有多个项目执行相同的事情。

**“Right now we have too much sprawl across our open source dependencies”**

**“现在我们的开源依赖规模过于庞大”**

This would make many aspects of open source management easier, from license compliance auditing to security to investing strategically in open source projects that are important to the company’s core process.

这使开源项目管理在许多方面变得更加容易，从许可证的合规性审计到安全性，再到对公司核心流程至关重要的开源项目进行战略性投资。

In addition to building standardized processes around how engineers can use open source, there’s also a need to create standard processes about how engineers can contribute to open source
projects or even create their own projects. In many organizations, these decisions had previously been made between an individual engineer and their manager, the result of which is a blend of approaches and a lack of certainty about what is acceptable.

除了围绕工程师如何使用开源项目以构建标准化流程之外，还需要创建标准流程，规范工程师如何为开源项目做出贡献甚至创建自己的项目。在许多组织中，以前只是由个别工程师和他们的经理之间做出决定就行，其结果是各种方法的混合，不确定最终会出现什么样的结果，以及这个结果是否可以接受。

Often part of an OSPO’s initial mandate is to create policies about both consuming and contributing to open source that are distributed throughout the engineering organization. The goal is to eliminate bottlenecks and confusion for engineers both in using and contributing back to open source.

OSPO的初始任务的一部分，通常是制定关于使用和贡献开源的政策，这些政策贯穿于整个工程团队中。其目标是消除工程师在使用和贡献开源方面的瓶颈和困惑。

### Improving an organization’s reputation
### 提升组织的声誉

Improving an organization’s reputation in the open source ecosystem is an important motivator for many companies to create an OSPO.

提升组织在开源生态系统中的声誉是许多公司创建OSPO的重要动力。

** “Our goal was to not only be more strategic and act with intent but also to elevate our reputation in the open source community— to be perceived as and accepted as a responsible, positive contributor to the open source ecosystem,” said Ambiel, of VMware.**

** VMware 的Ambiel说： “我们的目标不仅是让公司更具战略性，有目的地采取行动，还要提升我们在开源社区中的声誉，努力成为为开源生态系统负责任的、积极的贡献者。”**

This is particularly important because if a company shows up to a project without any kind of pre-existing relationship and suddenly needs a new feature, or a bug fixed, that request won’t likely be a priority. Whereas if the company has been consistently investing in being part of the community, when they need something, the community may be more likely to prioritize it.

这一点尤其重要，因为如果一家公司之前没有参与过某个开源项目，就贸然使用它，并且突然需要一个新功能或修复一个bug，那么该请求可能不会作为开源项目的优先事项。 然而如果公司一直致力于成为该社区的一部分，那么当他们需要某些东西时，社区就可能会优先考虑。

“We need to employ people who have commit rights,” said Prat, of Aiven, referring to commit rights on the projects Aiven is built around. The only way to get that is through continual investment in the project, which is why Aiven created an OSPO to ensure the company, and the individuals it employs, are active in the community.

Aiven的Prat说：“我们需要雇用拥有提交权限的人”。他指的是围绕Aiven的项目的提交权。实现这一目标的唯一方法是通过对该项目的持续投资，这就是Aiven创建OSPO的原因，以确保公司及其雇用的个人在社区中活跃。

An OSPO is also a way to share knowledge about how to approach open source. To even be part of the conversation about what it means to use open source strategically, a company probably needs
to establish an OSPO. According to Fukuchi, this knowledge sharing is a big part of the value Sony gets from its OSPO.

OSPO也是一种分享如何使用开源知识的方式。关于战略性地使用开源意味着什么，一家公司想要参与这类话题的讨论，需要建立自己的OSPO。根据Fukuchi的说法，这种知识共享的方式，是索尼从OSPO获得的价值的重要组成部分。

> While we associate open source with a grassroots effort from individual engineers, the overwhelming trend in the interviews was the support for OSPOs at the executive level. In the case of large technology companies, like VMware
and Futurewei, the OSPO champion was the CEO. “The CEO realized, oh, open source is not just about technology,” said Xie, from Futurewei. “It is about business. So they had open source moved into the Chief Strategy Office, which is where we’re now.”
Even in more grassroots initiatives, high-level buy-in is common. “I went to our former CTO with that idea myself,” said Vlatko, of Wayfair. “He was very supportive and said, ‘Yes, go ahead’ but also was very realistic in the sense of I cannot guide you, I’m not an expert. And I said, ‘That’s okay. I’m the expert.’”
The obvious takeaway is that in many companies, a strategic relationship with open source is a high-level business concern, not just a technical problem that a group of engineers should solve.

虽然我们将开源项目与个别工程师的基层努力联系在一起，但采访中的一个重要趋势是管理层对OSPO的支持。如对VMware和Futurewei等大型科技公司而言，OSPO的冠军是CEO。 “CEO 意识到，开源不仅仅与技术有关，”来自Futurewei的Xie说。 “这是关于商业的。 因此他们将开源的管理转移到首席战略办公室，这就是我们现在所在的部门。” 即使在较为基层的倡议中，高层的支持也很常见。 Wayfair的Vlatko说：“我亲自向我们的前任首席技术官提出了这个想法” 。他非常支持并说，“好的，请继续吧，但现实是我不能指导你，因为我不是专家。" 我说：“没关系，我是专家”。显而易见的是，在许多公司里，与开源的战略关系是一个高级业务问题，而不仅仅是一组工程师应该解决的技术问题。

Improving an organization’s reputation is ultimately about being able to work productively with others in the industry as well as being part of the conversation about the direction of key projects. “Growing our reputation allows us to be in larger market conversations in the tech world, where we can then have an impact on products and solutions that are important to us,” said Vlatko, of Wayfair.

提高组织的声誉，最终是为了能够与业内其他人进行富有成效的合作，并成为关于关键项目方向的对话的参与者。Wayfair的Vlatko说：“不断提高我们的声誉，使我们能够在科技界参与更大规模的市场对话，这会对我们的重要的产品和解决方案产生影响。”

### Expanding access to open knowledge
### 扩大对开放知识的访问与获取

For universities, an OSPO is a way to increase the impact of research and make it more accessible or useful to the wider community, as well as a way to improve students’ access to knowledge.

对于大学来说，OSPO是一种增加研究影响力的方式，使其更容易被广泛的社区所接受或使用，也是方便学生获取知识的一种方式。

**“If you have students engaged with reproducing the results, there have already been studies that show that there is a huge, much better learning effect compared to just reading papers.”**

**“已经有研究表明，相比于仅仅阅读论文，让学生参与研究重现结果，学习效果要好得多。”**

“It’s a huge difference whether a student can just read a paper, or they can look at the paper, then go on to an associated public git repository and have all the information there to reproduce the experiment,” said Maltzahn, of UC Santa Cruz. “If you have students engaged with reproducing the results, there have already been studies that show that there is a huge, much better learning effect compared to just reading papers.” This is important for student retention.
Many students leave computer science prematurely because they get too frustrated by the steep learning curve of getting brittle experimental systems to work in computing environments even experts don’t fully understand. Incorporating the practicality of open source into how students learn and reducing the frustration they experience can help them be successful with computer science in the short term and software development in the long term.

加州大学圣克鲁斯分校的Maltzahn说：“相对于只让学生阅读一篇论文来说，如果不仅可以查看论文，还可以访问相关的公共git代码库，在那里获得更多信息来重现实验，这两种方式的结果差异很大” 。 “已经有研究表明，与仅仅阅读论文相比，让学生参与重现结果，学习效果要好得多”。这对于留住学生很重要。许多学生过早地离开了计算机科学，因为他们对陡峭的学习曲线感到非常沮丧，因为要在脆弱的实验环境中工作，而有时候这些环境连专家都不能完全理解。将开源的实用性融入学生的学习方式，减少他们的挫败感，可以帮助他们在短期内获得学习计算机科学的成功，在长期内获得软件开发的成功。

### Improving development velocity
### 加快开发的速度

No one starts building a product by creating an operating system—nothing would ever get built.

没有人构建产品的第一步是创建操作系统，这样的话什么都做不出来。

**“There are parts of our products that consist almost entirely of open source software, and that is a fundamental change in the long history of Ericsson,” said Georg Kunz, open source manager at Ericsson.**

**爱立信开源经理Georg Kunz说：“我们一些产品几乎完全由开源软件组成，这是爱立信悠久历史中的一个根本性变化。”**

Not only does an OSPO bring order to how the company is consuming open source projects, but it can also provide guidance about which projects to use.

OSPO不仅可以规范公司使用开源项目的行为秩序，还会提供使用哪些项目的相关指导意见。

### Improve access to talent
### 改善获取人才的渠道

There are two ways that open source improves access to talent. The most obvious way is by allowing organizations to hire higher caliber engineers, either by improving their general reputation in the open source world or even by creating their own open source projects and hiring from the pool of people who become active in those projects’ communities. “My boss and executive sponsor want to know that we have a healthy relationship with the open source community because we need to hire from it,” said O’Brien, of Indeed.

开源提供两种方式以改善企业对人才的获取。最显而易见的方式是，让企业雇用更高水平的工程师，比如提升企业在开源世界的声誉，或企业自己创建开源项目，从项目社区的活跃人群中招聘。Indeed的O'Brien说：“我的老板和公司赞助商，他们想知道我们与开源社区有着健康的关系，因为我们需要从中招聘人才” 。

**“One of the biggest challenges we have— like other IT companies—is finding people to do all the software work”**

**“与其他IT公司一样，我们面临的最大挑战之一，是寻找人员来完成所有软件工作”**

The other way an OSPO, and the strategic approach to open source that comes with it, can improve access to talent is by creating open source projects that solve an organization’s problems, particularly when solving problems that are common in many organizations,
and solving them doesn’t provide any competitive advantage. “One of the biggest challenges we have—like other IT companies— is finding people to do all the software work,” said Schumacher, of DB Systel. If the company can create an open source project and collaborate with others in the industry, it can leverage tech talent without having to hire more people.

OSPO以及随之而来的开源战略方法为改善获取人才提供了另一种方式，创建开源项目来解决企业的问题，尤其是解决许多企业中常见的问题，解决这些问题并不会提供任何竞争优势。“与其他IT公司一样，我们面临的最大挑战之一，是寻找人员来完成所有软件工作，” DB Systel的Schumacher说。如果公司可以创建一个开源项目并与业内其他企业合作，就可以共享技术人才而无需雇用更多的人。

According to Schumacher, encouraging engineers to both use and contribute to open source is also one way to make them happy and less likely to leave. Similarly, encouraging more engineers to create open source projects and do more work in the open is a way to upskill the workforce you already have.

根据Schumacher的说法，鼓励工程师使用开源，并为开源做出贡献，也是让他们开心并不太可能离开公司的一种方式。同样，鼓励更多工程师创建开源项目并在开放环境中做更多工作，也是提高现有员工技能的一种方式。

“If we are showing our code externally, if we’re showing our technical prowess externally, there is a certain kind of element of needing to put your best foot forward,” said Vlatko, of Wayfair. She says that as Wayfair has encouraged people to work more in the open, they’ve seen code quality and general adherence to best practices improve.

Wayfair的Vlatko说：“如果我们向外展示我们的代码，向外展示我们的技术实力，那么就需要全力以赴。” 她说，由于Wayfair鼓励人们更多地参与开源工作，他们已经看到代码质量有所提高，也开始普遍遵守最佳实践原则。

### Mitigating risks
### 降低风险

There are different risks from open source, and a formal OSPO can help mitigate all of them. One reason to formalize the OSPO structure is that one or two engineers are fulfilling an OSPO-like role but without the title or structure. This is what happened at Ericsson. “We basically had a one-person OSPO,” said Kunz.
“He took care of everything, mostly focused on compliance, as many OSPOs start out doing. But obviously, that’s not sustainable. This guy should not get run over by a bus.”

开源会面临对不同的风险，正式的OSPO可以帮助降低这些风险。将OSPO组织结构正式化的原因之一是，一两个工程师正在履行类似OSPO的角色，但没有头衔或组织架构。这就是在爱立信发生的事情。“我们基本上只有一个人的OSPO，”Kunz 说。 “他负责一切，主要关注合规性，正如许多OSPO刚开始做的那样。但显然，这是不可持续的，万一这家伙被公共汽车撞倒了呢？”

Creating the OSPO formalizes what has often happened in an ad hoc way, reducing the reliance on tribal knowledge and lowering the risk that the departure of a single critical person could put the company at risk of legal issues, security incidents, or just being left out of the open source conversation.

创建OSPO以一种特别的方式，将经常发生的事情正式化了，减少了对部落知识的依赖，并降低了单个关键人物的离职使公司面临的法律问题、安全事件或被开源对话排除在外的风险。

### Security
### 安全性

Ensuring a company is staying as secure as possible—and particularly understanding the software bill of materials going into both internal and external applications—was a recurrent theme about how the OSPO provides value.

确保公司尽可能保持安全，尤其是了解进入公司内部和外部的应用程序的软件材料清单，是关于OSPO如何提供价值的一个反复出现的主题。

** “We cannot develop our own security framework without being in tune with what’s being developed collaboratively in the community”**

** “如果不与社区中协作开发的内容保持一致，我们就无法开发出自己的安全框架”**

However, the examples were on a strategic, rather than strict implementation, level. “We cannot develop our own security framework without being in tune with what’s being developed collaboratively in the community,” said O’Brien, from Indeed. “Then you take that, and you apply that across every domain.”

然而，这些例子是在战略层面，而不是严格的实施层面。 “如果不与社区中协作开发的内容保持一致，我们就无法开发出自己的安全框架，”来自Indeed的 O'Brien 说。 “然后你会把它应用到每个领域。”

“By design, it’s a distributed problem,” said Kunz, of Ericsson, about software supply chain security. “It’s not the best engineer who will solve this problem, and you can’t solve this problem with an internal process.” It’s something that requires working with others throughout the industry and the open source ecosystem. An OSPO gives organizations a way to do that, even if the OSPO is not ultimately responsible for implementing security processes. They do share best practices and facilitate collaboration among open source communities, industry actors, foundations, and other stakeholders to lift all security boats.

爱立信的Kunz在谈到软件供应链安全时说：“从设计上讲，这是一个分布式问题”。 “不是由最好的工程师来解决这个问题，也无法通过内部流程来解决这个问题。”这需要与整个行业和开源生态系统中的其他人合作。OSPO为组织提供了一种方法来解决这一问题，即使OSPO最终并不负责实施安全流程。OSPO组织可以分享最佳实践，并促进开源社区、行业参与者、基金会和其他利益相关者之间的协作，以提升所有的安全性。

Security is also a reason why organizations want to be involved and respected community members in projects that are strategically important to them. This allows them to be part of the behind-the-scenes conversations not only about any new features in the pipeline but also to learn about any potential security issues first.

安全性也是组织希望参与，并尊重社区成员参与对其具有战略意义的项目的原因之一。 这使他们能够参与幕后对话，不仅涉及协作中的任何新功能，而且还可以提前了解任何潜在的安全问题。

### Sustainability
### 可持续性

Sometimes open source projects are abandoned, and that can be bad if you depend on them. “If we have a strong dependency on a single maintainer
in Norway, then you should probably do something about the relationship with that person to make sure they stay engaged, either by ensuring that our developers spend time on the projects or by sending some money,” said Ploug, of Spotify. An OSPO both helps identify the risk—otherwise, the fact that it is a single maintainer could be unknown—and identify the best way to mitigate that risk.

开源项目有时也会被放弃，如果你依赖它们，那可能会很糟糕。”Spotify的Ploug说：“如果我们非常依赖挪威的某个项目维护人员，那么可能需要维持与他的关系，以确保他的参与，要么让我们的开发人员花时间维护项目，要么寄钱给他。OSPO既有助于识别风险（比如，你可能都不知道某个项目只有一个人维护）——也能识别减轻该风险的最佳方法。

This precise issue is what led O’Brien, at Indeed, to create the FOSS contributor fund, which is a way for Indeed to financially support maintainers of projects it depends on. The program’s goal is to support maintainers who are at high risk of burnout as a
way to mitigate the risk that the project will end up abandoned.

正是这个问题，促使Indeed的O’Brien创建了FOSS 贡献者基金，这是Indeed为其所依赖项目的维护者提供财务支持的一种方式。该计划的目标是支持那些极有可能精疲力竭的项目维护人员，以减少项目最终被放弃的风险。

> The majority of OSPO leaders we spoke to had a software engineering background, but the work most of them do on a day-to-day basis is often not related to writing code. Instead, there are elements of internal communication, strategic planning, analysis, event planning, and collaboration
with external organizations, which include open source communities, foundations, and other industry peers.

我们采访过的大多数OSPO领导者都有软件工程背景，但他们中的大多数人的日常工作通常与编写代码无关。取而代之的是内部沟通、战略规划、分析、活动规划以及与外部组织的合作，包括开源社区、基金会和其他行业同行。

> 
> In most cases, OSPO team members, and especially OSPO leaders, were senior engineers or at the management level. In companies with very structured salary bands, the OSPO leadership and team members would be toward the top of the salary ladder.
> Given the importance of legal compliance for many organizations when the OSPO starts, it is notable that most OSPOs had access to legal expertise, either inside or outside the OSPO. However, none of the interviewees felt that there should be an expansion of the role of legal or that they needed additional legal expertise.

在大多数情况下，OSPO团队成员，尤其是OSPO领导人，都是高级工程师或管理层。在薪资范围非常结构化的公司中，OSPO领导层和团队成员将处于薪资阶梯的顶端。 考虑到OSPO启动时，对许多组织来说，遵守法律是非常重要的，但值得注意的是，大多数OSPO都可以获得OSPO内部或外部的法律专业知识。没有一个受访者认为，应该扩大法律的作用，或者他们需要额外的法律专业知识。
