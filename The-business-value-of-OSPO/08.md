## 展望未来

On one point, there was absolute agreement among all interviewees: OPSOs will continue to evolve in the future. In particular, the more established an OPSO is, the more it can think strategically and help the entire organization develop a more strategic, thoughtful approach to open source. What they do
not need or expect is more focus on legal and compliance—that is a checkbox that most interviewees feel is more like the bare minimum and that they have got it covered already.

有一点是所有受访者都达成了绝对的一致：OSPO 未来将会持续发展。特别是，OSPO 越是成熟，就越能进行战略思考，并帮助整个组织制定一种更具战略意义、更深思熟虑的开源策略。他们并不需要也不期望更多地关注法律合规性，这是一种检查项，但大多数受访者认为这更像是一个最低要求，并且他们已经覆盖了这一方面。

Several interviewees spoke about expecting OSPOs to play a larger role in influencing which technologies and projects their companies adopt in the future. There was also a hope that OSPOs will be able to dive deeper into the dependency chain to better understand which projects they depend on, even if it is two or three levels down, and track the health of those projects (and contribute where necessary). Others talked about building out automated platforms to handle some of the tasks that are now manual, like approving a request to contribute to a project.

几位受访者谈到，希望 OSPO 在影响其公司未来采用的技术和项目方面发挥更大的作用。也有人希望 OSPO 能够更深入地研究依赖关系链，更好地了解他们所依赖的项目，哪怕只是两三级依赖的项目，并跟踪这些项目的健康状况（以及在必要时做出贡献）。其他人谈到了构建自动化平台来处理一些当前手动执行的任务，比如批准贡献项目的申请。

“The OSPO needs to work on a strategy, set it up, and then bring the R&D folks on board to do the right thing,” said Kunz. The OSPO, Kunz and many others believe, should be working on vision and strategy and making sure they’re working with the right people throughout the company to turn that vision into reality.

Kunz 说：“OSPO 需要基于一项战略来开展工作，建立战略并让研发人员参与进来做正确的事情。”。Kunz 及其他许多人认为，OSPO 应该致力于愿景和战略，并确保他们与整个公司的合适人选合作，将愿景变为现实。

Ultimately, part of the OSPO’s role is to have these conversations about open source, OSPOs, and the business value it delivers. That is part of open source evangelism, which is already part of many OSPOs’ mission. “I think an important part of that is really making people understand the business value,” said Schumacher.

归根结底，OSPO 的部分职责是就开源、OSPO 及其提供的商业价值进行对话。这是开源布道的一部分，也已经是许多 OSPO 使命的一部分。Schumacher 说：“我认为这其中很重要的一个部分是让人们真正理解商业价值。”。

That is not always easy because open source does not always translate neatly to the things business leaders think about, but it’s important. Business leaders often know that open source is important, but they need an OSPO to help them understand why and then use that knowledge to get even more value out of
open source.

这通常并不容易，因为开源并不总是能很好地转化为商业领袖的所思所想，但这很重要。商业领袖通常知道开源很重要，但他们需要一个 OSPO 来帮助他们理解为什么，然后利用这些知识从开源中获得更多价值。

## Future research
## 后续研究
In this report, we have focused on the value of the OSPO in private institutions. One area of future research we would like to explore is how OSPOs provide value to governments, from municipalities to supra-national organizations. We would also like to do research that explores the role and the value of OSPOs exclusively at institutions of higher learning. If you have any thoughts about either subject or would like to share your insights, contact us at research@linuxfoundation.org.

本报告中，我们重点关注了 OSPO 在私营机构中的价值。我们未来想探索的研究领域之一是 OSPO 如何为政府提供价值，从市政部门到超大型国家组织。我们还想做一些研究，专门探讨 OSPO 在高等院校的作用和价值。如果您对这两个主题有任何想法或想分享您的见解，请联系我们 research@linuxfoundation.org 。
