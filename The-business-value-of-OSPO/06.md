# The different hats of an OSPO

# 开源办公室的不同角色

Sometimes a strategic approach just means stepping back and taking the time to think through some of the hard questions about what type of engagement model is right for any particular project or how involved the organization should be in each project. There is also the question of when it makes sense to contribute to an existing project versus creating a new project. An OSPO that is having these strategy-level conversations will be able to provide guidelines to engineers so that engineers do not have to consider the business implications of different open source engagement models every time they try to solve a problem.

战略方法有时候仅仅意味着后退一步，花时间思考那些关于特定项目哪种参与模式是对的或者组织应该在每个项目中参与到什么程度等困难的问题。这在考虑是向已经存在的项目贡献还是新建一个项目时也是一个问题。有战略层对话的开源办公室能够为工程师提供指点，以便工程师每次尝试解决问题时不需考虑不同开源参与模式对业务的影响。

The OSPO also plays a sort of translation role between engineering teams and business interests regarding open source. “How do we ensure that engineers keep having the time to do this, that they can actually prove that it makes sense from a business perspective?” said Abernathy, about how communicating the business value of open source is part of the OSPO’s job at F5.
These strategic questions are not always top of mind when the OSPO is first created, especially at less tech-focused companies where open source doesn’t present a direct threat to revenue. But even those companies eventually see that using open source well is about more than mitigating license compliance risk. “Now we are also looking into more cases where it makes sense from a strategic point of view to leverage open source for our own projects or in collaborations with other parties,” said Schumacher, even though he does not think these strategic concerns were as important when the OSPO was initially set up.

开源办公室还在开源相关的工程团队和业务利益之间扮演着一种翻译角色。“我们怎么确保工程师有足够的时间做这些，他们实际上可以从商业的角度证明好处是什么” Abernathy说，如何传达开源的商业价值是 F5 开源办公室工作的一部分。这些开源战略问题并不总是在开源办公室创建时就要考虑的首要问题，特别是开源对收入没有直接威胁的技术不是重心的公司。但是，即使是这些公司最终也会看到良好地使用开源也不仅仅是为了缓和许可证合规风险。“现在我们在更多的情况下研究利用开源为我们自己的项目或者与他方合作的战略意义。” Schumacher 说，即使他不认为这些战略考虑在设立开源办公室时就很重要。

## Ensuring OSPO sustainability

## 确保开源办公室的可持续性

Continuity is an ongoing challenge for organizations as they adapt to changes in the business, the competitive landscape, and the larger technological ecosystem. According to “A Deep Dive on OSPOs,” a Linux Foundation whitepaper, OSPOs need to establish a clear, easy reporting process and ensure lines of communication stay open with all the stakeholders. This is important for maintaining internal support for the OSPO, which is critical to ensuring that the organization continues to follow its agreed-upon open source strategy and is able to work sustainability on open source projects and priorities.[^2]

连续性对组织来说是持续的挑战，因为它们要适应业务，竞争环境和更大的技术生态。根据 Linux 基金会的白皮书《深入开源办公室》，开源办公室需要建立清晰、简单的汇报流程，并确保与所有利益相关方保持沟通渠道畅通。维护开源办公室内部支持对于确保组织继续按照其商定的开源战略和能够在开源项目和优先事项上至关重要。[^2]
