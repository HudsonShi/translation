CONCLUSIONS AND ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS


A clear upskilling trend
Organizations need to focus on upskilling their workforce in emerging technology areas, such as cloud / containers, cyber-
security, and AI / ML. With technology constantly evolving, companies must invest in training and certification opportu-
nities to ensure that they equip their employees with the necessary skills to remain competitive. The survey shows that 
organizations are taking different approaches to upskill their workforce, such as providing training opportunities and 
hiring new talent with experience in these areas.


Investing in upskilling is crucial for companies looking to keep up with emerging technologies and remain competitive in 
the market.


Todayâ€™s hiring challenges require a multi-pronged approach 
The survey results highlight the difficulties organizations face in hiring technical talent in today's tight labor market. While 
it is tempting for some companies to rely solely on external recruitment efforts to address the shortage, the data suggests 
this may not be enough. Instead, alternative approaches such as upskilling existing employees, offering increased salaries, 
improving work / life balance, and providing opportunities to work on open source projects can effectively attract and 
retain top talent.


Organizations need to be creative in their approach to hiring and consider alternative solutions to overcome the chal-
lenges posed by the current tech talent shortage.


Organizations need streamlined hiring and onboarding processes
The data reveals that organizations must streamline their hiring and onboarding processes to reduce turnover rates 
and increase efficiency. Even with efficient processes in place, recruitment and onboarding remain time-consuming. 
High turnover rates suggest it might be better to focus on upskilling existing employees rather than relying on external 
recruitment efforts.


Improving onboarding and training programs can help organizations reduce turnover rates and ensure that new hires 
effectively integrate into the company culture and team dynamics.
