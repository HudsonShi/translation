Executive Summary
The 2023 State of Tech Talent Report provides valuable insights into the current and future technology staffing requirements and skills needed within organizations. 
This report is based on a global survey conducted by Linux Foundation Training & Certification and Linux Foundation Research in February and March 2023 of over 
400 hiring managers and staffing professionals addressing the needs of both end-user organizations and technology providers. 


Conclusion
The 2023 State of Tech Talent Report 
provides valuable insights into the 
ongoing changes and challenges in 
the tech industry workforce. As the 
tech industry continues to evolve, it is 
clear that a commitment to ongoing 
learning and development will be 
crucial for individuals and organiza-
tions seeking to stay ahead of the 
curve. We hope hiring managers find 
this report useful in their training and 
staffing efforts and encourage you to 
participate in future Linux Foundation 
research projects.


Upskilling is also becoming more 
important for recruitment purposes. 
When unable to find suitable tech-
nical candidates, organizations train 
existing employees more often than 
hiring consultants. This suggests that 
organizations recognize the value of 
investing in their existing staff and the 
challenges of finding the right external 
candidates.


Certification and pre-
employment testing
Respondents felt that certification and 
pre-employment testing are necessary 
to verify skills to address the chal-
lenges of finding the right candidate. 
This tool is useful to ensure organi-
zations hire the right people for the 
job. It also gives candidates a clear 
understanding of the skills they must 
demonstrate to succeed in the role.


Impact of economic 
concerns
One of the report's key findings is 
the impact of economic concerns on 
technical hiring plans. More than 50% 
of organizations surveyed reported 
revising their hiring plans by freezing 
new positions. This is likely due to the 
ongoing global economic uncertainty 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and 
other factors, including inflation and 
geopolitical conflicts.


Demand for skilled 
technical talent
More organizations plan to increase 
their technical staff than decrease. 
This is a positive sign for those seeking 
employment in the tech industry. The 
demand for skilled tech talent remains 
strong, particularly in newer areas such 
as cloud / containers, cybersecurity, 
and AI / ML. Respondents identified 
these areas as the primary focus for 
hiring in 2023.


Shift in technical roles
Another interesting finding is the shift 
in the types of technical roles being 
hired for. While senior technical roles 
have seen the biggest job cuts, new 
hiring focuses more on developers 
and IT management. This suggests 
organizations seek skilled individuals 
who can contribute to project imple-
mentation, management, and tech-
nical development.


Training and upskilling
To address the changing hiring land-
scape, training and upskilling are 
becoming increasingly important strat-
egies for organizations. The report 
highlights that 70% of organizations 
surveyed provide training opportu-
nities for their existing technical staff 
on new technologies. This is a positive 
sign, as it suggests a commitment by 
organizations to the ongoing devel-
opment of their employees and 
keeping their staff up to date with the 
latest technologies and practices.
