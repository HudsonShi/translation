CONCLUSIONS AND ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS


Comprehensive training and certification  
programs should supplement hiring
The results of this yearâ€™s survey underscore the importance of investing in upskilling and certification opportunities to 
address the technical talent shortage. Certification and pre-employment testing can verify claimed technical skills while 
upskilling, effective onboarding, and certifications are highly valued and important for success.


While budgetary constraints are affecting both smaller and larger organizations in 2023, it is essential to recognize the 
value of training and certification in ensuring that technical staff possess the necessary skills to succeed in an increas-
ingly tech-driven business environment.


Training and certification are important in an 
increased or reduced hiring environment
Training is crucial for increased or reduced hiring activity. The data also suggests that job cuts are to blame for revenue 
misses and economic caution, highlighting the importance of taking a strategic approach to hiring and staffing decisions. 
Organizations need to be aware of the types of staff most affected by staffing cuts, such as senior staff members, and be 
strategic in their hiring efforts by targeting roles such as developers and IT management that are commonly recruited for.


Organizations that are reducing staff or pausing hiring plans need to focus on upskilling their existing workforce to 
prevent negative outcomes such as increased workloads and longer time frames for product delivery.
