## CHAPTER 5 MODIFIED SOURCE AND BINARY DISTRIBUTION

## 第5章 修改源代码和二进制分发

In this chapter, we discuss the two core sections that define the rights and obligations for those who modify, improve, and/or redistribute GPL'd software. These sections, GPLv2 2--3, define the central core rights and requirements of GPLv2.

本章中，我们讨论了修改、改进和/或重新分发GPL软件的权利和义务的两个核心部分。这些部分，即GPLv2 2-3，定义了GPLv2的核心权利和要求。

### GPLv2 §2: Share and Share Alike

### GPLv2 第2条：分享和分享相同

For many, this is where the "magic" happens that defends software freedom upon redistribution. GPLv2 2 is the only place in GPLv2 that governs the modification controls of copyright law. If users distribute modified versions a GPLv2'd program, they must follow the terms of GPLv2 2 in making those changes. Thus, this sections ensures that the body of GPL'd software, as it continues and develops, remains Free as in freedom. To achieve that goal, GPLv2 2 first sets forth that the rights of redistribution of modified versions are the same as those for verbatim copying, as presented in GPLv2 1. Therefore, the details of charging money, keeping copyright notices intact, and other GPLv2 1 provisions are intact here as well. However, there are three additional requirements.

对于许多人来说，这就是“魔法”发生的地方，它在重新分发时保护了软件自由。GPLv2 2是在GPLv2中仅控制版权法修改控制的地方。如果用户分发了GPLv2'd程序的修改版本，他们必须遵循GPLv2 2的条款进行更改。因此，这些部分确保了GPL'd软件库随着其不断发展和发展，仍然保持自由。为了实现这个目标，GPLv2 2首先规定修改版本的重新分发权与逐字复制的重新分发权相同，就像GPLv2 1中所述的那样。因此，收费细节、版权声明完整性和其他GPLv2 1规定也在这里得到保留。但是，还有三个额外的要求。

#### The Simpler Parts of GPLv2 §2

### GPLv2第2条简单部分

The first (GPLv2 2(a)) requires that modified files carry "prominent notices" explaining what changes were made and the date of such changes. This section does not prescribe some specific way of marking changes nor does it control the process of how changes are made. Primarily, GPLv2 2(a) seeks to ensure that those receiving modified versions know the history of changes to the software. For some users, it is important to know that they are using the standard version of program, because while there are many advantages to using a fork, there are a few disadvantages. Users should be informed about the historical context of the software version they use, so that they can make proper support choices. Finally, GPLv2 2(a) serves an academic purpose --- ensuring that future developers can use a diachronic approach to understand the software.

第一个（GPLv2 2（a））要求修改的文件要带有“重要通知”，解释了进行了哪些更改以及更改的日期。本节并未规定标记更改的某种特定方式，也不控制更改的过程。主要是为了确保接收修改版本的人知道软件的变更历史。对于某些用户，知道他们正在使用程序的标准版本很重要，因为虽然使用分支有很多优点，但也有一些缺点。用户应该了解他们使用的软件版本的历史背景，以便他们可以做出适当的支持选择。最后，GPLv2 2（a）具有学术目的 - 确保未来的开发人员可以使用历时的方法来理解软件。

GPLv2 2(c), a relatively simple section, requires that any program which (before modification) "normally reads commands interactively when run" and displays or prints legal information also display all copyright notices, warranty disclaimer, modification indications and a pointer to the license, even in modified versions. The requirement is relatively simple, and relates to an important policy goal of copyleft: downstream users should be informed of their rights. Its implications and details are straightforward and simple.

GPLv2 2（c）是一个相对简单的部分，要求在运行之前“通常会交互地读取命令”的任何程序，以及显示或打印法律信息的程序也必须在修改版本中显示所有版权声明、保证免责声明、修改指示和指向许可证的指针。这个要求相对简单，与copyleft的一个重要政策目标有关：下游用户应该知道他们的权利。它的影响和细节是简单明了的。

#### GPLv2 §2(b)

#### GPLv2 2(b)

Meanwhile, GPLv2 2(b) requires careful and extensive study. Its four short lines embody the some of the essential legal details of "share and share alike". These 46 words are considered by some to be the most worthy of careful scrutiny because they can be a source of great confusion when not properly understood. In considering GPLv2 2(b), first note the qualifier: it *only* applies to derivative, combined and/or modified works that "you distribute or publish". Despite years of education efforts on this matter, many still believe that modifiers of GPL'd software *must* publish or otherwise share their changes. On the contrary, GPLv2 2(b) **does not apply if** the changes are never distributed. Indeed, the freedom to make private, personal, unshared changes to software for personal use only should be protected and defended.[^1^](#_bookmark60)

与此同时，GPLv2第2条(b)要求仔细而广泛的研究。它的四行简短文字包含了“共享及共享同类”的一些基本法律细节。这46个单词被一些人认为是最值得仔细审查的，因为当它们没有被正确理解时，它们可以成为极大的混淆源。在考虑GPLv2第2条(b)时，首先要注意限定语：它仅适用于您分发或发布的派生、组合和/或修改作品。尽管在这个问题上已经进行了多年的教育工作，但许多人仍然认为GPL'd软件的修改者必须发布或以其他方式分享他们的修改。相反，GPLv2第2条(b)不适用于从未分发的更改。事实上，应该保护和维护仅用于个人使用的私人、个人、未共享软件的更改的自由。[^1^](#_bookmark60)

Next, we again encounter the same matter that appears in GPLv2 *§*0, in the following text:

接下来，我们再次遇到出现在GPLv2§0中的相同问题，如下所示：

>"\...that in whole or part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof."

>"...包含或源自程序或其任何部分的全部或部分内容。"

Again, the GPL relies here on copyright law. If, under copyright law, the modified version "contains or is derived from" the GPL'd software, then the requirements of GPLv2 2(b) apply. The GPL invokes its control as a copyright license over the modification of the work in combination with its control over distribution of the work.

同样，GPL在这里依赖于版权法。如果根据版权法，修改版本“包含或源自”GPL的软件，则适用GPLv2第2条(b)的要求。GPL通过其对作品修改和分发的版权许可证的控制来调用其控制。

The final clause of GPLv2 2(b) describes what the licensee must do if she distributes or publishes a modified version of the work --- namely, the following:

The final clause of GPLv2 2(b) describes what the licensee must do if she distributes or publishes a modified version of the work --- namely, the following:

GPLv2第2条(b)的最后一条款描述了许可证持有人在分发或发布作品的修改版本时必须执行的操作，即以下内容：

>\[The work must\] be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

>作品必须作为一个整体在本许可证的条款下免费授权给所有第三方使用。

That is probably the most tightly-packed phrase in all of the GPL. Consider each subpart carefully.

这可能是GPL中最密集的短语。仔细考虑每个子部分。

The work "as a whole" is what is to be licensed. This is an important point that GPLv2 2 spends an entire paragraph explaining; thus this phrase is worthy of a lengthy discussion here. As a programmer modifies a software program, she generates new copyrighted material --- fixing expressions of ideas into the tangible medium of electronic file storage. That programmer is indeed the copyright holder of those new changes. However, those changes are part and parcel to the original work distributed to the programmer under GPL. Thus, the license of the original work affects the license of the new whole combined and/or derivative work.

"作为一个整体"的作品是需要被授权的。这是GPLv2 2节用整个段落解释的一个重要观点，因此这个短语在这里值得进行详细的讨论。当程序员修改一个软件程序时，她产生了新的版权材料——将思想的表达形式固定到电子文件存储的有形媒介中。那个程序员确实是这些新变化的版权持有人。然而，这些变化是与GPL下分发给程序员的原始作品紧密相关的。因此，原始作品的许可证影响新整个组合和/或派生作品的许可证。

It is certainly possible to take an existing independent work (called) and combine it with a GPL'd program (called ). The license of , when it is distributed as a separate and independent work, remains the prerogative of the copyright holder of . However, when is combined with , it produces a new work that is the combination of the two (called + ). The copyright of this combined work, + , is held by the original copyright holder of each of the two works.

当一个独立的作品（称为 ）与GPL的程序（称为 ）结合时，很可能出现的情况是：当 作为一个单独和独立的作品分发时，其许可证仍然是版权持有人的专属权利。然而，当与 一起组合时，它们产生了一个新的作品（称为 ），它是两个作品的组合。新作品 + 的版权由两个作品的原始版权持有人持有。

In this case, GPLv2 2 lays out the terms by which + may be distributed and copied. By default, under copyright law, the copyright holder of would not have been permitted to distribute + ; copyright law forbids it without the expressed permission of the copyright holder of . (Imagine, for a moment, if were a proprietary product --- would its copyright holders give you permission to create and distribute + without paying them a hefty sum?) The license of , the GPL, states the options for the copyright holder of who may want to create and distribute + . The GPL's pre-granted permission to create and distribute combined and/or derivative works, provided the terms of the GPL are upheld, goes far above and beyond the permissions that one would get with a typical work not covered by a copyleft license. Thus, to say that this condition is any way unreasonable is simply ludicrous.

在这种情况下，GPLv2 §2详细说明了可以分发和复制+的条款。根据版权法，默认情况下，不允许拥有者在未经许可的情况下分发+；版权法禁止这样做。 （想象一下，如果是一个专有产品，其版权持有者会允许您创建和分发+而不支付他们巨额费用吗？）GPL，即版权协议，规定了可能希望创建和分发+的版权所有者的选项。在遵守GPL条款的情况下，预先授予创建和分发组合和/或派生作品的权限远远超出了未受到版权通用许可证保护的作品所能获得的许可权限。因此，认为这个条件在任何方面都是不合理的纯属荒谬。

The GPL recognizes what is outside its scope. When a programmer's work is "separate and independent" from any GPL'd program code with which it could be combined, then the obligations of copyleft do not extend to the work separately distributed. Thus, Far from attempting to extend copyleft beyond the scope of copyright, the licenses explicitly recognize.

GPL认识到超出其范围的事情。当程序员的工作与任何可以与之结合的GPL程序代码“独立且独立”时，版权义务不适用于单独分发的工作。因此，远非试图将通用许可证超出版权范围，这些许可证明确承认了超出其范围的事情。

Thus, GPL recognizes what is outside its scope. When a programmer's work is "separate and inde- pendent" from any GPL'd program code with which it could be combined, then copyleft obligations do not extend to the independent work separately distributed. Thus, far from attempting to extend copyleft beyond the scope of copyright, GPL explicitly limits the scope of copyleft to the scope of copyright.

因此，GPL认识到超出其范围的事情。当程序员的工作与任何可以与之结合的GPL程序代码“独立且独立”时，版权义务不适用于单独分发的工作。因此，远非试图将通用许可证超出版权范围，这些许可证明确限制了通用许可证的范围，以符合版权的范围。

[^1^](#_bookmark60.anchor)Most Free Software enthusiasts believe there is a **moral** obligation to redistribute changes that are generally useful, and they often encourage companies and individuals to do so. However, there is a clear distinction between what one **ought** to do and what one **must** do.

[^1^](#_bookmark60.anchor)大多数自由软件爱好者认为有一种道德义务重新分发通常有用的更改，他们经常鼓励公司和个人这样做。然而，有一个明确的区别，即人们应该做什么和人们必须做什么。

GPL does not, however (as is sometimes suggested) distinguish "dynamic" from "static" linking of pro- gram code. It is occasionally suggested that a subroutine "dynamically" linked to GPL'd code is, by virtue of the linking alone, inherently outside the scope of copyleft on the main work. This is a misunderstanding. When two software components are joined together to make one work (whether a main and some library subroutines, two objects with their respective methods, or a program and a "plugin") the combination infringes the copyright on the components if the combination required copyright permission from the com- ponent copyright holders, as such permission was either not available or was available on terms that were not observed.

GPL并不区分程序代码的“动态”链接和“静态”链接，尽管有时会有这种说法。有时会建议将一个“动态”链接到GPL代码的子例程视为单独存在于版权保护范畴之外，仅仅由于链接本身。这是一种误解。当两个软件组件被连接在一起形成一个整体（无论是主要程序和一些库子例程、两个具有各自方法的对象还是程序和“插件”）时，如果组合需要从组件版权持有人获得版权许可，而此类许可证要么不可用，要么是在未遵守条款的情况下可用，那么该组合就会侵犯这些组件的版权。

In other words, when combining other software with GPL'd components, the only available permission is GPL. The combiner must observe and respect the GPL observed on the combination as a whole. It matters not if that combination is made with a linker before distribution of the executable, is made by the operating system in order to share libraries for execution efficiency at runtime, or results from runtime references in the language at runtime (as in Java programs).

换句话说，当将其他软件与GPL组件结合使用时，唯一可用的许可是GPL。组合者必须尊重并遵守GPL作为整体所遵守的规定。无论这种组合是在链接器在可执行文件分发之前进行的，还是由操作系统在运行时为了共享库而进行的，或者是由语言在运行时的运行时引用所导致的（如Java程序）。

The next phrase of note in GPLv2 2(b) is "licensed . . . at no charge." This phrase confuses many. The sloppy reader points out this as "a contradiction in GPL" because (in their confused view) that clause of GPLv2 2 says that re-distributors cannot charge for modified versions of GPL'd software, but GPLv2 1 says that they can. Avoid this confusion: the "at no charge" **does not** prohibit re-distributors from charging when performing the acts governed by copyright law,[^2^](#_bookmark62) but rather that they cannot charge a fee for the *license itself*. In other words, redistributors of (modified and unmodified) GPL'd works may charge any amount they choose for performing the modifications on contract or the act of transferring the copy to the customer, but they may not charge a separate licensing fee for the software.

GPLv2 2(b)中需要注意的下一句话是“免费授权”。这句话让很多人感到困惑。粗心的读者会指出这是“GPL中的矛盾”，因为（在他们混淆的观点中）GPLv2 2中的这一条款说，重新发布者不能为GPL软件的修改版本收费，而GPLv2 1却说他们可以。避免这种混淆： “免费”不是禁止重新发布者在执行受版权法约束的行为时收费，^2^ 而是他们不能为软件本身收取单独的许可费用。换句话说，（修改和未修改的）GPL作品的重新发布者可以为执行合同上的修改或向客户传递副本的行为收取任意金额，但他们不能为软件收取单独的许可费。

GPLv2 2(b) further states that the software must "be licensed . . . to all third parties." This too yields some confusion, and feeds the misconception mentioned earlier --- that all modified versions must be made available to the public at large. However, the text here does not say that. Instead, it says that the licensing under terms of the GPL must extend to anyone who might, through the distribution chain, receive a copy of the software. Distribution to all third parties is not mandated here, but GPLv2 2(b) does require re- distributors to license the whole work in a way that extends to all third parties who may ultimately receive a copy of the software.

GPLv2 2(b)进一步规定软件必须“授权……给所有第三方使用。”这也导致了一些困惑，并滋生了前面提到的误解，即所有修改版本都必须向公众公开。然而，这里的文字并没有说到这一点。相反，它说授权必须延伸到通过分发渠道可能获得软件副本的任何人。这里并没有强制要求向所有第三方分发，但GPLv2 2(b)要求再分发者以一种方式授权整个作品，使其适用于最终可能接收到软件副本的所有第三方。

In summary, GPLv2 2(b) says what terms under which the third parties must receive this no-charge license. Namely, they receive it "under the terms of this License", the GPLv2. When an entity *chooses* to redistribute a work based on GPL'd software, the license of that whole work must be GPL and only GPL. In this manner, GPLv2 *§*2(b) dovetails nicely with GPLv2 *§*6 (as discussed in Section [7.3](#gplv2-6-gpl-my-one-and-only) of this tutorial).

总之，GPLv2 2(b)规定了第三方必须获得此无费许可证的条款。换句话说，他们获得的是“本许可证”的条款，即GPLv2。当一个实体选择基于GPL软件再分发作品时，整个作品的许可证必须是GPL，只能是GPL。通过这种方式，GPLv2 §2(b)与GPLv2 §6（如本教程的7.3部分所讨论的）紧密结合。

The final paragraph of GPLv2 2 is worth special mention. It is possible and quite common to aggregate various software programs together on one distribution medium. Computer manufacturers do this when they ship a pre-installed hard drive, and GNU/Linux distribution vendors do this to give a one-stop CD or URL for a complete operating system with necessary applications. The GPL very clearly permits such "mere aggregation" with programs under any license. Despite what you hear from its critics, the GPL is nothing like a virus, not only because the GPL is good for you and a virus is bad for you, but also because simple contact with a GPL'd code-base does not impact the license of other programs. A programmer must expend actual effort to cause a work to fall under the terms of the GPL. Redistributors are always welcome to simply ship GPL'd software alongside proprietary software or other unrelated Free Software, as long as the terms of GPL are adhered to for those packages that are truly GPL'd.

GPLv2第2节的最后一段值得特别提及。在一个分发介质上聚合各种软件程序是可能且很常见的。计算机制造商在出货时这样做，GNU/Linux发行商则提供一站式CD或URL以获取具有必要应用程序的完整操作系统。GPL非常明确地允许这种“纯聚合”与任何许可证下的程序一起使用。尽管你从批评者那里听到的不是这样，GPL与病毒完全不同，不仅因为GPL对你有益而病毒对你有害，而且因为与GPL的代码库的简单接触不会影响其他程序的许可证。程序员必须实际努力才能使一个作品适用于GPL的条款。再分发者总是欢迎将GPL软件与专有软件或其他无关的自由软件一起分发，只要真正使用GPL的软件包的条款遵守GPL即可。

#### Right to Private Modification

### 私有修改权

The issue of private modifications of GPLv2'd works deserves special attention. While these rights are clearly explicit in GPLv3 2 2 (see [9.4](#gplv3-2-basic-permissions) of this tutorial for details), the permission to create private modifications is mostly implicit in GPLv2. Most notably, the requirements of GPLv2 2 (and GPLv2 3, which will be discussed next) are centered around two different copyright controls: both modification *and* distribution. As such, GPLv2 2's requirements need only be met when a modified version is distributed; one need not follow them for modified versions that are not distributed.[^3^](#_bookmark65)

对于 GPLv2 的作品进行私有修改的问题需要特别注意。虽然 GPLv3 2 2 中明确列出了这些权利（有关详情请参见本教程的 9.4 部分），但是在 GPLv2 中，创造私有修改的许可大多是暗含的。特别是，GPLv2 2（和将在下一节讨论的 GPLv2 3）的要求围绕两个不同的版权控制展开：修改和分发。因此，只有在分发修改版本时才需要遵守 GPLv2 2 的要求；对于未分发的修改版本，不需要遵守这些要求。[^3^](#_bookmark65)

[^2^](#_bookmark62.anchor)Recall that you could by default charge for any acts not governed by copyright law, because the license controls are confined by copyright.

[^2^](#_bookmark62.anchor)请记住，您默认可以收取任何不受版权法约束的行为费用，因为许可控制受版权限制。

However, the careful reader of GPLv2 will notice that, unlike GPLv3, no other clauses of the license actually give explicit permission to make private modifications. Since modification of software is a control governed by copyright, a modifier needs permission from the copyright holder to engage in that activity.

然而，仔细阅读 GPLv2 的读者会注意到，与 GPLv3 不同，许可证的其他条款实际上没有明确允许进行私有修改的许可。由于软件修改是受版权控制的控制，因此修改者需要获得版权持有人的许可才能从事这项活动。

In practice, however, traditional GPLv2 interpretation has always assumed that blanket permission to create non-distributed modified versions was available, and the [FSF has long opined that distribution of](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic) [modified versions is never mandatory.](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#GPLRequireSourcePostedPublic) This issue is one of many where GPLv3 clarifies in explicit text the implicit policy and intent that was solidified via long-standing interpretation of GPLv2.

然而，在实践中，传统的 GPLv2 解释一直假定拥有创造非分发修改版本的全面许可，而FSF 长期以来一直认为分发修改版本从来不是强制性的。这个问题是 GPLv3 明确文本阐明了长期解释 GPLv2 所确定的隐含政策和意图的众多问题之一。

### GPLv2 §3: Producing Binaries

### GPLv2 第3条：生成二进制文件

Software is a strange beast when compared to other copyrightable works. It is currently impossible to make a film or a book that can be truly obscured. Ultimately, the full text of a novel, even one written by William Faulkner, must be presented to the reader as words in some human-readable language so that they can enjoy the work. A film, even one directed by David Lynch, must be perceptible by human eyes and ears to have any value.

与其他可版权作品相比，软件是一种奇特的生物。目前还没有一种能真正被隐藏的电影或书籍。即使是威廉·福克纳写的小说全文也必须以某种人类可读的语言形式呈现给读者，以便他们能够享受这部作品。一部由大卫·林奇执导的电影也必须可被人类的眼睛和耳朵感知才有任何价值。

Software is not so. While the source code --- the human-readable representation of software --- is of keen interest to programmers, users and programmers alike cannot make the proper use of software in that human-readable form. Binary code --- the ones and zeros that the computer can understand --- must be predicable and attainable for the software to be fully useful. Without the binaries, be they in object or executable form, the software serves only the didactic purposes of computer science.

软件不同。尽管源代码是软件的人类可读表现形式，对程序员来说是非常重要的，但用户和程序员不能以这种人类可读的形式正确地使用软件。二进制代码，即计算机能够理解的一和零，必须是可预测且可获得的，才能充分发挥软件的作用。如果没有二进制文件，无论是目标文件还是可执行文件，该软件只能用于计算机科学的教学目的。

Under copyright law, binary representations of the software are simply modified versions (and/or deriva- tive works) of the source code. Applying a systematic process (i.e., "compilation"[^4^](#_bookmark66)) to a work of source code yields binary code. The binary code is now a new work of expression fixed in the tangible medium of electronic file storage.

根据版权法，软件的二进制表示只是源代码的修改版本（和/或派生作品）。将源代码作品应用一种系统的过程（即“编译”）会产生二进制代码。现在，二进制代码是以电子文件存储为载体的新的表达形式。

Therefore, for GPL'd software to be useful, the GPL, since it governs the rules for creation of modified works, must grant permission for the generation of binaries. Furthermore, notwithstanding the relative popularity of source-based GNU/Linux distributions like Gentoo, users find it extremely convenient to receive distribution of binary software. Such distribution is the redistribution of modified works of the software's source code. GPLv2 3 addresses the matter of creation and distribution of binary versions.

因此，为了让GPL的软件有用，GPL必须授予生成二进制文件的许可，因为它管理修改作品的规则。此外，尽管基于源代码的GNU/Linux发行版（如Gentoo）相对受欢迎，用户发现接收二进制软件的分发非常方便。这种分发是软件源代码的修改作品的再分发。GPLv2 3解决了创建和分发二进制版本的问题。

Under GPLv2 3, binary versions may be created and distributed under the terms of GPLv2 1--2, so all the material previously discussed applies here. However, GPLv2 3 must go a bit further. Access to the software's source code is an incontestable prerequisite for the exercise of the fundamental freedoms to modify and improve the software. Making even the most trivial changes to a software program at the binary level is effectively impossible. GPLv2 3 must ensure that the binaries are never distributed without the source code, so that these freedoms are passed through the distribution chain.

根据GPLv2 3，可以在GPLv2 1-2的条款下创建和分发二进制版本，因此之前讨论的所有材料在这里都适用。但是，GPLv2 3必须更进一步。访问软件源代码是行使修改和改进软件的基本自由的必要条件。在二进制层面上进行最微小的更改实际上是不可能的。GPLv2 3必须确保二进制文件没有在未提供源代码的情况下进行分发，以便这些自由通过分发链传递。

GPLv2 3 permits distribution of binaries, and then offers three options for distribution of source code along with binaries. The most common and the least complicated is the option given under GPLv2 3(a).

GPLv2 3允许分发二进制文件，然后提供了三种选项，以便将源代码与二进制文件一起分发。最常见且最简单的选项是GPLv2 3(a)提供的选项。

GPLv2 3(a) offers the option to directly accompany the source code alongside the distribution of the binaries. This is by far the most convenient option for most distributors, because it means that the source- code provision obligations are fully completed at the time of binary distribution (more on that later).

GPLv2第3条(a)提供了在二进制文件分发的同时直接附带源代码的选择。这对于大多数分发者来说是最方便的选择，因为它意味着在二进制分发时完全完成了源代码提供义务（稍后将更详细地说明）。

#### Complete, Corresponding Source (CCS)

#### 完整、对应的源代码（CCS）

Under GPLv2 3(a), the source code provided must be the "corresponding source code." Here "correspond- ing" primarily means that the source code provided must be that code used to produce the binaries being distributed. That source code must also be "complete". GPLv2 3's penultimate paragraph explains in de- tail what is meant by "complete". In essence, it is all the material that a programmer of average skill would need to actually use the source code to produce the binaries she has received. Complete source is required so that, if the licensee chooses, she should be able to exercise her freedoms to modify and redistribute changes. Without the complete source, it would not be possible to make changes that were actually directly derived from the version received.

在GPLv2 3(a)下，提供的源代码必须是“对应的源代码”。在这里，“对应的”主要意味着提供的源代码必须是用于生成所分发的二进制文件的代码。该源代码还必须是“完整的”。GPLv2 3的倒数第二段详细解释了“完整”的含义。实质上，它是程序员需要实际使用源代码来生成收到的二进制文件所需的所有材料。需要完整的源代码，以便许可证持有人选择时，可以行使修改和重新分发更改的自由。如果没有完整的源代码，就不可能制作实际上是直接源自所收到版本的更改。

[^3^](#_bookmark65.anchor)As a matter of best practice, it's useful to assume that all software may eventually be distributed later, even if there no plans for distribution at this time. Too often, GPL violations occur because of a late distribution decision of software that was []{#_bookmark66 .anchor}otherwise never intended for distribution.

[^3^](#_bookmark65.anchor)作为最佳实践，有用的做法是假定所有软件最终都可能被分发，即使现在没有分发计划。由于本来没有意图进行分发的软件最终作出了分发决定，因此往往会出现GPL违规行为。

[^4^](#_bookmark65.anchor)"Compilation" in this context refers to the automated computing process of converting source code into binaries. It has absolutely nothing to do with the term "compilation" in copyright statues.

[^4^](#_bookmark65.anchor)在此上下文中，“编译”是指将源代码自动转换为二进制文件的计算过程。它与版权法规中的“编译”一词完全无关。

Based on the appearance of those two words, GPL theorists will often refer to the source code required under the previsions of this section as "Complete, Corresponding Source", sometimes abbreviated as CCS. CCS is not a formal, defined term in GPLv2, but rather, GPL theorists coined the acronym CCS to embody not just the concepts of "complete" and "corresponding" as found in GPLv2, but the entirety of GPLv2's requirements for source code provisioning. In other words, GPL theorists might say: "the company provided some source, but it wasn't CCS", which would mean the source code failed in some ways to meet some term of GPLv2.

基于这两个词的出现，GPL理论家经常将此部分规定要求的源代码称为“完整、对应的源代码”，有时缩写为CCS。CCS不是GPLv2中的正式定义术语，而是GPL理论家创造出的缩写，它不仅代表了GPLv2中“完整”和“对应”的概念，而且代表了GPLv2对源代码提供的全部要求。换句话说，GPL理论家可能会说：“公司提供了一些源代码，但它不是CCS”，这意味着源代码在某些方面未能满足GPLv2的某些条款。

Indeed, CCS needs completely include not just that source which is directly translated by the compiler into object code, but other materials necessary to convert the source into equivalent binaries. Specifically, GPLv2 3 requires that the source code include "meta-material" like scripts, interface definitions, and other material that is used to "control compilation and installation" of the binaries. In this manner, those further down the distribution chain are assured that they have the unabated freedom to build their own modified works from the sources provided.

事实上，CCS必须完全包括不仅直接由编译器转换为目标代码的源代码，还包括将源代码转换为等效二进制文件所需的其他材料。具体而言，GPLv2 3要求源代码包括“元材料”，如脚本、接口定义和其他用于“控制编译和安装”二进制文件的材料。以这种方式，分销链中的下游用户可以确保他们可以从提供的源代码构建自己的修改作品，而没有受到任何限制。

This requirement is not merely of theoretical value. If you pay a high price for a copy of GPL'd binaries (which comes with CCS, of course), you have the freedom to redistribute that work at any fee you choose, or not at all. Sometimes, companies attempt a GPL-violating cozenage whereby they produce very specialized binaries (perhaps for an obscure architecture). They then give source code that does correspond, but withhold the "incantations" and build plans they used to make that source compile into the specialized binaries. Such distributions violate GPL, since the downstream users cannot effectively "control compilation and installation" of the binaries.

这个要求不仅仅具有理论价值。如果你花了高价购买了带有CCS的GPL二进制文件副本，你就有自由以任何你选择的费用重新分发该作品，或者根本不分发。有时，一些公司会尝试违反GPL的欺诈手段，他们会生产非常专业化的二进制文件（也许是针对某种不常见的架构），然后提供相应的源代码，但是却不提供他们用来将这个源代码编译成专业化二进制文件所需要的"咒语"和构建计划。这样的发行版违反了GPL，因为下游用户无法有效地"控制编译和安装"这些二进制文件。

#### Additional Source Provision Options

### 其他提供源代码的选项

Software distribution comes in many forms. Embedded manufacturers, for example, have the freedom to put GPL'd software into mobile devices with very tight memory and space constraints. In such cases, putting the source right alongside the binaries on the machine itself might not be an option. While it is recommended that this be the default way that people comply with GPL, the GPL does provide options when such distribution is unfeasible.

软件分发有多种形式。例如，嵌入式制造商可以自由地将GPL软件放入内存和空间非常有限的移动设备中。在这种情况下，将源代码放在机器上的二进制文件旁边可能不是一个选择。尽管建议这是人们遵守GPL的默认方式，但当这种分发不可行时，GPL确实提供了选项。

GPLv2 3, therefore, allows source code to be provided on any physical "medium customarily used for software interchange." By design, this phrase covers a broad spectrum --- the phrase seeks to pre-adapt to changes in technology. When GPLv2 was first published in June 1991, distribution on magnetic tape was still common, and CD was relatively new. By 2002, CD was the default. By 2007, DVD's were the default. Now, it's common to give software on USB drives and SD cards. This language in the license must adapt with changing technology.

因此，GPLv2 3允许在任何“用于软件交换的通常物理介质”上提供源代码。这个短语的设计旨在涵盖广泛的领域，它试图预先适应技术的变化。当GPLv2于1991年6月首次发布时，磁带分发仍然很常见，而CD则相对较新。到2002年，CD是默认选项。到2007年，DVD成为默认选项。现在，常见的做法是在USB驱动器和SD卡上提供软件。许可证中的这种语言必须随着技术的变化而适应。

Meanwhile, the binding created by the word "customarily" is key. Many incorrectly believe that dis- tributing binary on CD and source on the Internet is acceptable. In the corporate world in industrialized countries, it is indeed customary to simply download a CDs' worth of data quickly. However, even today in the USA, many computer users are not connected to the Internet, and most people connected to the Internet still have limited download speeds. Downloading CDs full of data is not customary for them in the least. In some cities in Africa, computers are becoming more common, but Internet connectivity is still available only at a few centralized locations. Thus, the "customs" here are normalized for a worldwide userbase. Simply providing source on the Internet --- while it is a kind, friendly and useful thing to do --- is not usually sufficient.

与此同时，“通常”一词所造成的约束是关键。许多人错误地认为在CD上分发二进制文件，在互联网上提供源代码是可以接受的。在工业化国家的公司世界中，只需快速下载一张CD的数据是很常见的。但是，即使是今天，在美国许多计算机用户仍未连接到互联网，大多数连接到互联网的人仍然具有有限的下载速度。对他们来说，下载充满数据的CD是一件非常不寻常的事情。在非洲的一些城市，计算机变得越来越普遍，但互联网连接仍然只在少数集中的位置可用。因此，这里的“惯例”是针对全球用户群的。仅仅在互联网上提供源代码——虽然这是一件善意和有用的事情——通常是不够的。

Note, however, a major exception to this rule, given by the last paragraph of GPLv2 3. *If* distribution of the binary files is made only on the Internet (i.e., "from a designated place"), *then* simply providing the source code right alongside the binaries in the same place is sufficient to comply with GPLv2 *§*3.

然而，GPLv2 3最后一段给出了一个主要例外。如果二进制文件的分发只是在互联网上进行（即“从指定的位置”），那么在同一位置直接提供源代码与二进制文件就足以符合GPLv2 §3的要求。

As is shown above, under GPLv2 3(a), embedded manufacturers can put the binaries on the device and ship the source code along on a CD. However, sometimes this turns out to be too costly. Including a CD with every device could prove too costly, and may practically (although not legally) prohibit using GPL'd software. For this situation and others like it, GPLv2*§* 3(b) is available.

如上所示，在GPLv2 3(a)下，嵌入式制造商可以将二进制文件放在设备上并将源代码放在CD上进行运输。然而，有时这种做法会被认为成本过高。为每个设备包含CD可能会过于昂贵，而且实际上可能（尽管法律上不允许）禁止使用GPL'd软件。对于这种情况和其他类似情况，GPLv2 § 3(b)是可用的。

GPLv2 3(b) allows a distributor of binaries to instead provide a written offer for source code alongside those binaries. This is useful in two specific ways. First, it may turn out that most users do not request the source, and thus the cost of producing the CDs is saved --- a financial and environmental windfall. In addition, along with a GPLv2 3(b) compliant offer for source, a binary distributor might choose to *also* give a URL for source code. Many who would otherwise need a CD with source might turn out to have those coveted high bandwidth connections, and are able to download the source instead --- again yielding environmental and financial windfalls.

GPLv2 3(b)允许二进制分发者提供书面源代码提供，而不是与这些二进制文件一起提供源代码。这有两个具体的用途。首先，可能大多数用户不请求源代码，因此节省了制作CD的成本 - 这是一笔财务和环境的收益。此外，与GPLv2 3(b)兼容的源代码提供书面提供，二进制分发者可能会选择为源代码也提供URL。许多其他需要源CD的人可能会发现拥有所需的高带宽连接，能够下载源代码，从而再次产生环境和财务收益。

However, note that regardless of how many users prefer to get the source online, GPLv2 3(b) does place lasting long-term obligations on the binary distributor. The binary distributor must be prepared to honor that offer for source for three years and ship it out (just as they would have had to do under GPLv2 3(a)) at a moment's notice when they receive such a request. There is real organizational cost here: support engineers must be trained how to route source requests, and source CD images for every release version for the last three years must be kept on hand to burn such CDs quickly. The requests might not even come from actual customers; the offer for source must be valid for "any third party".

但是，请注意，无论有多少用户喜欢在线获取源代码，GPLv2 3(b)都会对二进制分发者产生长期的持续义务。二进制分发者必须准备好在三年内执行源代码提供书面提供的义务，并在收到此类请求时立即运输（就像在GPLv2 3(a)下所必须做的那样）。这里确实存在实际的组织成本：支持工程师必须接受培训以了解如何路由源请求，并且必须保留过去三年每个发布版本的源CD映像以便快速刻录这些CD。这些请求甚至可能不是来自实际的客户；源代码提供书面提供必须对“任何第三方”有效。

That phrase is another place where some get confused --- thinking again that full public distribution of source is required. The offer for source must be valid for "any third party" because of the freedoms of redistribution granted by GPLv2 1--2. A company may ship a binary image and an offer for source to only one customer. However, under GPL, that customer has the right to redistribute that software to the world if she likes. When she does, that customer has an obligation to make sure that those who receive the software from her can exercise their freedoms under GPL --- including the freedom to modify, rebuild, and redistribute the source code.

这句话是另一个容易让人困惑的地方 —— 再次认为必须完全公开发布源代码。由于 GPLv2 1-2 授予的再分发自由，源代码的提供必须对“任何第三方”有效。一家公司可以向一个客户提供一个二进制映像和一个源代码的提供，但在 GPL 下，该客户有权将该软件重新分发给全世界，如果她愿意的话。当她这样做时，该客户有义务确保那些从她那里接收软件的人可以行使 GPL 下的自由权利，包括修改、重建和重新分发源代码。

GPLv2 3(c) is created to save her some trouble, because by itself GPLv2 3(b) would unfairly favor large companies. GPLv2 3(b) allows the separation of the binary software from the key tool that people can use to exercise their freedom. The GPL permits this separation because it is good for re-distributors, and those users who turn out not to need the source. However, to ensure equal rights for all software users, anyone along the distribution chain must have the right to get the source and exercise those freedoms that require it.

GPLv2 3(c) 的创建是为了节省她的一些麻烦，因为单独 GPLv2 3(b) 将不公平地偏向大公司。GPLv2 3(b) 允许将二进制软件与人们用于行使其自由的关键工具分离。GPL 允许这种分离，因为这对重新分发者和那些不需要源代码的用户是有益的。然而，为了确保所有软件用户的平等权利，沿着分发链的任何人都必须有权获取源代码并行使需要源代码的自由。

Meanwhile, GPLv2 3(b)'s compromise primarily benefits companies that distribute binary software commercially. Without GPLv2 3(c), that benefit would be at the detriment of the companies' customers; the burden of source code provision would be unfairly shifted to the companies' customers. A customer, who had received binaries with a GPLv2 3(b)-compliant offer, would be required under GPLv2 (sans GPLv2 3(c)) to acquire the source, merely to give a copy of the software to a friend who needed it. GPLv2 3(c) reshifts this burden to entity who benefits from GPLv2 3(b).

与此同时，GPLv2 3(b) 的妥协主要使得商业分发二进制软件的公司受益。如果没有 GPLv2 3(c)，这种利益将损害公司的客户；源代码提供的负担将不公平地转移到公司的客户身上。一个已收到 GPLv2 3(b)-兼容提供的二进制文件的客户，将根据 GPLv2 (不带 GPLv2 3(c)) 要求获取源代码，仅仅是为了将软件副本提供给需要的朋友。GPLv2 3(c) 将这个负担重新转移到从 GPLv2 3(b) 受益的实体身上。

GPLv2 3(c) allows those who undertake *noncommercial* distribution to simply pass along a GPLv2 3(b)- compliant source code offer. The customer who wishes to give a copy to her friend can now do so without provisioning the source, as long as she gives that offer to her friend. By contrast, if she wanted to go into business for herself selling CDs of that software, she would have to acquire the source and either comply via GPLv2 3(a), or write her own GPLv2 3(b)-compliant source offer.

GPLv2 3(c) 允许那些进行“非商业”分发的人简单地传递一个 GPLv2 3(b) —— 兼容的源代码提供。希望将副本交给她朋友的客户现在可以这样做，而无需提供源代码，只要她把这个提供转交给她的朋友即可。相比之下，如果她想自己开业，销售该软件的 CD，她将不得不获取源代码，并通过 GPLv2 3(a) 或编写自己的 GPLv2 3(b) —— 兼容的源代码提供来遵守 GPL。

This process is precisely the reason why a GPLv2 3(b) source offer must be valid for all third parties. At the time the offer is made, there is no way of knowing who might end up noncommercially receiving a copy of the software. Companies who choose to comply via GPLv2 3(b) must thus be prepared to honor all incoming source code requests. For this and the many other additional necessary complications under GPLv2 *§§*3(b--c), it is only rarely a better option than complying via GPLv2 *§*3(a).

这个过程正是 GPLv2 3(b) 源代码提供必须对所有第三方有效的原因。在提供源代码的时候，没有办法知道谁会非商业地获得软件的副本。因此，选择通过 GPLv2 3(b) 来遵守许可证的公司必须准备好满足所有源代码请求。因为在 GPLv2 §3(b-c) 下有许多其他必要的复杂程序，所以这种方式通常不如遵守 GPLv2 §3(a)。
