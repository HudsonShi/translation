## CHAPTER 14 BEST PRACTICES TO AVOID COMMON VIOLATIONS

## 第14章 避免常见违规的最佳实践

Unlike highly permissive licenses (such as the ISC license), which typically only require preservation of copy- right notices, licensees face many important requirements from the GPL. These requirements are carefully designed to uphold certain values and standards of the software freedom community. While the GPL's re- quirements may initially appear counter-intuitive to those more familiar with proprietary software licenses, by comparison, its terms are in fact clear and quite favorable to licensees. Indeed, the GPL's terms actually simplify compliance when violations occur.

与高度宽容的许可证（如ISC许可证）通常只需要保留版权声明的要求不同，许可证持有人面临许多来自GPL的重要要求。这些要求被精心设计来维护软件自由社区的某些价值观和标准。虽然对于那些更熟悉专有软件许可证的人而言，GPL的要求可能最初似乎有些违反直觉，但与之相比，它的条款实际上是明确的并且对许可证持有人非常有利的。事实上，当出现违规时，GPL的条款实际上简化了合规性。

GPL violations occur (or, are compounded) most often when companies lack sound practices for the incorporation of GPL'd components into their internal development environment. This section introduces some best practices for software tool selection, integration and distribution, inspired by and congruent with software freedom methodologies. Companies should establish such practices before building a product based on GPL'd software.[^14-1^]

当公司在其内部开发环境中整合GPL组件时，GPL违规（或加剧）的情况最常见于公司缺乏可靠的实践。本节介绍了一些基于软件自由方法的软件工具选择、集成和分发的最佳实践。公司应在基于GPL软件构建产品之前建立这些实践。[^14-1^]

### 14.1 Evaluate License Applicability

### 14.1 评估许可证适用性

Political discussion about the GPL often centers around determining the "work" that must be licensed under GPL, or in other words, "what is the derivative and/or combined work that was created". Nearly ever esoteric question asked by lawyers seek to consider that question [^14-2^] (perhaps because that question explores exciting legal issues while the majority of the GPL deals with much more mundane ones). Of course, GPL was designed primarily to embody the licensing feature of copyleft.

关于GPL的政治讨论通常集中于确定必须在GPL下许可的“作品”，换句话说，“创作了什么派生和/或组合作品”。律师们几乎询问了每一个奇怪的问题，以考虑这个问题[^14-2^]（也许是因为这个问题探讨了令人兴奋的法律问题，而GPL的大多数内容都涉及更为平凡的问题）。当然，GPL的设计主要是体现copyleft的许可特性。

However, most companies who add complex features to and make combinations with GPL'd software are already well aware of their more complex obligations under the license that require complex legal analysis. And, there are few companies overall that engage in such activities. Thus, in practical reality, this issue is not relevant to the vast majority of companies distributing GPL'd software.

然而，大多数向GPL软件添加复杂功能并与之组合的公司已经充分了解许可证下更复杂的义务，这些义务需要进行复杂的法律分析。而且，总体上从事此类活动的公司很少。因此，在实际情况下，这个问题对于分发GPL软件的绝大多数公司来说并不相关。

Thus, experienced GPL enforcers find that few redistributors' compliance challenges relate directly to combined work issues in copyleft. Instead, the distributions of GPL'd systems most often encountered typically consist of a full operating system including components under the GPL (e.g., Linux, BusyBox) and components under the LGPL (e.g., the GNU C Library). Sometimes, these programs have been patched or slightly improved by direct modification of their sources, and thus the result is unequivocally a modified version. Alongside these programs, companies often distribute fully independent, proprietary programs, developed from scratch, which are designed to run on the Free Software operating system but do not combine with, link to, modify, derive from, or otherwise create a combined work with the GPL'd components.[^14-3^] In the latter case, where the work is unquestionably a separate work of creative expression, no copyleft provisions are invoked. The core compliance issue faced, thus, in such a situation, is not an discussion of what is or is not a combined, derivative, and/or modified version of the work, but rather, issues related to distribution and conveyance of binary works based on GPL'd
source, but without Complete, Corresponding Source.

因此，有经验的GPL执法者发现，很少有再分发者的合规挑战直接涉及到在Copyleft中的组合工作问题。相反，最常遇到的是包含GPL组件（例如Linux，BusyBox）和LGPL组件（例如GNU C库）的完整操作系统的分发。有时，这些程序通过直接修改其源代码进行修补或略微改进，因此结果是明确的修改版本。除了这些程序外，公司通常还会分发完全独立的专有程序。即那些独立开发的软件，旨在运行在自由软件操作系统上，但不与GPL的组件组合，链接，修改，派生或以其他方式创建一个结合作品。[^14-3^] 在后一种情况下，如果作品毫无疑问是一份独立的创意表达作品，则不会引用版权保护规定。因此，在这种情况下，所面临的核心合规问题不是讨论作品是否为组合，派生或修改版本，而是涉及基于GPL源代码的二进制作品的分发和传递问题，但没有提供完整的对应源代码。

[^14-1^]: This document addresses compliance with GPLv2, GPLv3, LGPLv2, and LGPLv3. Advice on avoiding the most common errors differs little for compliance with these four licenses. [18.1](#lgpl-compliance) discusses the key differences between GPL and LGPL compliance.


[^14-2^]: This tutorial in fact also addresses the issue at length in *§* [14.1.](#evaluate-license-applicability)


As such, issues of software delivery are the primary frustration for GPL enforcers. In particular, the following short list accounts for at least 95% of the GPL violations ever encountered:

因此，软件交付问题是GPL执行者主要遇到的挫折。特别是以下简短清单中至少占了95%的GPL违规行为：

The violator fails to provide required information about the presence of copylefted programs and their applicable license terms in the product they have purchased.

违规者未能提供关于他们购买的产品中存在的版权保护程序及其适用的许可证条款的所需信息。

The violator fails to reliably deliver [complete, corresponding source](#ccs-definition) (CCS) for copylefted programs the violator knew were included (i.e., the CCS is either delivered but incomplete, or is not delivered at all).

违规者未能可靠地交付违规者知道已包含的版权保护程序的完整对应源代码 (CCS)（即，CCS被交付但不完整，或者根本没有被交付）。

Requestors are ignored when they communicate with violator's published addresses requesting fulfill- ment of businesses' obligations.

当请求者通过违规者公布的地址联系请求履行义务时，被忽视。

This tutorial therefore focuses primarily on these issue. Admittedly, a tiny minority of compliance situations relate to question of derivative, combined, or modified versions of the work. Those situations are so rare, and the details from situation to situation differ greatly. Thus, such situations require a highly fact-dependent analysis and cannot be addressed in a general-purpose document such as this one.

因此，本教程主要关注这些问题。不可否认，极少数的合规情况涉及到作品的派生、合并或修改版本的问题。这些情况非常罕见，并且各种情况之间的细节差异很大。因此，这些情况需要进行高度依赖事实的分析，不能在这样一个通用性的文档中解决。

Most companies accused of violations lack a basic understanding of how to comply even in the straight- forward scenario. This document provides those companies with the fundamental and generally applicable prerequisite knowledge. For answers to rarer and more complicated legal questions, such as whether your software is a derivative or combined work of some copylefted software, consult with an
attorney.[^4^](#_bookmark182)

大多数被指控违规的公司甚至缺乏基本的理解如何在简单的情况下进行合规性操作。本文档提供了这些公司所需的基本和普遍适用的先决知识。对于更罕见和更复杂的法律问题，例如您的软件是否是某些版权保护软件的派生或合并作品，请咨询律师^4^。

This discussion thus assumes that you have already identified the "work" covered by the license, and that any components not under the GPL (e.g., applications written entirely by your developers that merely happen to run on a Linux-based operating system) distributed in conjunction with those works are separate works within the meaning of copyright law and the GPL. In such a case, the GPL requires you to provide complete corresponding source (CCS)[^5^](#_bookmark183) for the GPL'd components and your modifications thereto, but not for independent proprietary applications. The procedures described in this
document address this typical scenario.

因此，本讨论假定您已经确定了受许可证保护的“作品”，并且在与这些作品一起分发的任何未受GPL保护的组件（例如，完全由您的开发人员编写的仅恰好在基于Linux的操作系统上运行的应用程序）中，根据版权法和GPL的意义，它们是独立的作品。在这种情况下，GPL要求您提供GPL保护的组件及其修改的完整对应源代码(CCS)[^5^](#_bookmark183]，但不包括独立的专有应用程序。本文档中描述的程序解决了这种典型情况。

### 14.2 Monitor Software Acquisition

### 14.2 监控软件采购

Software engineers deserve the freedom to innovate and import useful software components to improve products. However, along with that freedom should come rules and reporting procedures to make sure that you are aware of what software that you include with your product.

软件工程师应该拥有创新和引入有用软件组件来改进产品的自由。然而，与此自由相应的应该是规则和报告程序，以确保您知道您所包含产品中的哪些软件。

The most typical response to an initial enforcement action is: "We didn't know there was GPL'd stuff in there". This answer indicates failure in the software acquisition and procurement process. Integration of third-party proprietary software typically requires a formal arrangement and management/legal oversight before the developers incorporate the software. By contrast, developers often obtain and integrate Free Software without intervention nor oversight. That ease of acquisition, however, does not mean the oversight is any less necessary. Just as your legal and/or management team negotiates terms for inclusion of any proprietary software, they should gently facilitate all decisions to bring Free Software into your product.

最典型的初步执行行动的回应是：“我们不知道里面有GPL的东西。”这个答案表明软件采购和采购流程的失败。第三方专有软件的集成通常需要正式的安排和管理/法律监督，然后开发人员才能将该软件纳入产品中。相比之下，开发人员通常无需干预或监督即可获得和集成自由软件。但是，这种获取的便利性并不意味着监督就不再必要了。正如您的法律和/或管理团队为纳入任何专有软件而协商条款一样，他们应该慢慢促进所有决定将自由软件引入您的产品。

Simple, engineering-oriented rules help provide a stable foundation for Free Software integration. For example, simply ask your software developers to send an email to a standard place describing each new Free Software component they add to the system, and have them include a brief description of how they will incorporate it into the product. Further, make sure developers use a revision control system (such as Git or Mercurial), and store the upstream versions of all software in a "vendor branch" or similar mechanism, whereby they can easily track and find the main version of the software and, separately, any local changes. Such procedures are best instituted at your project's launch. Once chaotic and poorly-sourced development processes begin, cataloging the presence of GPL'd components becomes challenging.

简单的工程规则有助于为自由软件集成提供稳定的基础。例如，只需要求您的软件开发人员将每个新的自由软件组件添加到系统中的标准位置发送电子邮件，并包括他们将如何将其集成到产品中的简要描述。此外，确保开发人员使用修订控制系统（如Git或Mercurial），并将所有软件的上游版本存储在“供应商分支”或类似机制中，从而可以轻松地跟踪和查找软件的主版本以及任何本地更改。这些程序最好在项目启动时实施。一旦混乱和低质量的开发过程开始，就会变得很难记录GPL的组件的存在。

[^14-3^]: However, these programs do often combine with LGPL'd libraries. This is discussed in detail in [18.1.](#lgpl-compliance)




*§* [9.3](#gplv3-1-understanding-ccs) of this tutorial.


Such a situation often requires use of a tool to "catch up" your knowledge about what software your product includes. Most commonly, companies choose some software licensing scanning tool to inspect the codebase. However, there are few tools that are themselves Free Software. Thus, GPL enforcers usually recommend the GPL'd [FOSSology system,](http://fossology.org/) which analyzes a source code base and produces a list of Free Software licenses that may apply to the code. FOSSology can help you build a catalog of the sources you have already used to build your product. You can then expand that into a more structured inventory and process.

这种情况通常需要使用一种工具来“跟进”了解产品包含的软件。最常见的做法是选择一些软件许可扫描工具来检查代码库。然而，很少有工具本身是自由软件。因此，GPL 执法者通常推荐 GPL 的 FOSSology 系统，它可以分析源代码库，并生成可能适用于代码的自由软件许可证列表。FOSSology 可以帮助您建立一个您已经使用的源代码的目录，然后将其扩展为更结构化的清单和流程。

### 14.3 Track Your Changes and Releases

### 14.3 跟踪你的变更与发布

As explained in further detail below, the most important component of GPL compliance is the one most often ignored: proper inclusion of CCS in all distributions of GPL'd software. To comply with GPL's CCS requirements, the distributor *must* always know precisely what sources generated a given binary distribution. In an unfortunately large number of our enforcement cases, the violating company's engineering team had difficulty reconstructing the CCS for binaries distributed by the company. Here are three simple rules to follow to decrease the likelihood of this occurrence:

如下所述，GPL合规的最重要组成部分是最常被忽略的：在所有GPL软件的发布中正确包含CCS。为了遵守GPL的CCS要求，分发者必须始终精确地知道哪些源代码生成了特定的二进制分发。在我们的许多执法案件中，违规公司的工程团队通常难以重建公司分发的二进制文件的CCS。以下是三个简单的规则，可以降低这种情况发生的可能性：

- Ensure that your developers are using revision control systems properly.

- 确保您的开发人员正确使用版本控制系统。
- Have developers mark or "tag" the full source tree corresponding to builds distributed to customers.
- 确保您的开发人员正确使用版本控制系统。

Check that your developers store all parts of the software development
in the revision control system, including readmes, build scripts,
engineers' notes, and documentation.

检查开发人员是否将软件开发的所有部分存储在版本控制系统中，包括readme、构建脚本、工程师的笔记和文档。

Your developers will benefit anyway from these rules. Developers will
be happier in their jobs if their tools already track the precise
version of source that corresponds to any deployed binary.

无论如何，您的开发人员都会受益于这些规则。如果他们的工具已经跟踪与部署的二进制文件相对应的精确源代码版本，开发人员将更加愉快地工作。

### 14.4 Avoid the "Build Guru"

### 14.4 避免“构建大师”

Too many software projects rely on only one or a very few team members
who know how to build and assemble the final released product. Such
knowledge centralization not only creates engineering redundancy
issues, but also thwarts GPL compliance. Specifically, CCS does not
just require source code, but scripts and other material that explain
how to control compilation and installation of the executable and
object code.

太多的软件项目仅依赖于一个或非常少数的团队成员，他们知道如何构建和组装最终发布的产品。这种知识集中不仅会创建工程冗余问题，还会阻碍GPL合规。具体而言，CCS不仅需要源代码，还需要脚本和其他材料，以说明如何控制可执行和目标代码的编译和安装。

Thus, avoid relying on a "build guru", a single developer who is the
only one who knows how to produce your final product. Make sure the
build process is well defined. Train every developer on the build
process for the final binary distribution, including (in the case of
embedded software) generating a final firmware image suitable for
distribution to the customer. Require developers to use revision
control for build processes. Make a rule that adding new components to
the system without adequate build instructions (or better yet,
scripts) is unacceptable engineering practice.

因此，避免依赖“构建大师”，即只有一个开发人员知道如何生成您的最终产品。确保构建过程被明确定义。对最终二进制分发的构建过程对每个开发人员进行培训，包括（在嵌入式软件的情况下）生成适合分发给客户的最终固件映像。要求开发人员在构建过程中使用版本控制。制定规则，即添加新组件到系统中，如果没有足够的构建说明（或更好的是脚本），则是不可接受的工程实践。
