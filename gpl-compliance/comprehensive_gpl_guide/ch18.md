## CHAPTER 18 SPECIAL TOPICS IN COMPLIANCE

## 第18章 合规的特别话题

There are several other issues that are less common, but also relevant in a GPL compliance situation. To those who face them, they tend to be of particular interest.

在GPL合规情况下，还有一些不太常见但也相关的问题。对于那些面临这些问题的人，它们往往具有特别的兴趣。

### 18.1 LGPL Compliance

### 18.1 GPL 合规

GPL compliance and LGPL compliance mostly involve the same issues. As we discussed in [14.1,](#evaluate-license-applicability) questions of modified versions of software are highly fact-dependent and cannot be easily addressed in any overview document. The LGPL adds some additional complexity to the analysis. Namely, the various LGPL versions permit proprietary licensing of certain types of modified versions. These issues are discussed in greater detail in Chapter [10](#_bookmark147) and [11.](#_bookmark158) However, as a rule of thumb, once you have determined (in accordance with LGPLv3) what part of the work is the "Application" and what portions of the source are "Minimal Corresponding Source", then you can usually proceed to follow the GPL compliance rules that discussed above, replacing our discussion of "Corresponding Source" with "Minimal Corresponding Source".

GPL合规性和LGPL合规性大多涉及相同的问题。正如我们在14.1中讨论的那样，关于软件修改版本的问题高度依赖于事实，并且无法在任何概述性文件中轻易解决。LGPL在分析中增加了一些额外的复杂性。即，各种LGPL版本允许某些类型的修改版本使用专有许可证。这些问题在第10章和第11章中进行了更详细的讨论。然而，作为一个经验法则，一旦你已经确定了（按照LGPLv3的规定）工作的哪个部分是“应用程序”，源代码的哪些部分是“最小对应源代码”，那么你通常可以继续遵循上面讨论的GPL合规规则，将我们对“对应源代码”的讨论替换为“最小对应源代码”。

LGPL also requires that you provide a mechanism to combine the Application with a modified version of the library, and outlines some options for this. Also, the license of the whole work must permit "reverse engineering for debugging such modifications" to the library. Therefore, you should take care that the EULA used for the Application does not contradict this permission.

LGPL还要求你提供一种将应用程序与库的修改版本结合的机制，并概述了一些选项。此外，整个工作的许可证必须允许“反向工程调试此类修改”到库中。因此，你应该注意，应用程序使用的EULA不应违反此许可。

Thus, under the terms of LGPL, you must refrain from license terms on works based on the licensed work that prohibit replacement of the licensed components of the larger non-LGPL'd work, or prohibit decompilation or reverse engineering in order to enhance or fix bugs in the LGPL'd components.

因此，在LGPL的条款下，你必须避免授权作品的许可条款，这些作品禁止替换较大的非LGPL作品的授权组件，或禁止反汇编或反向工程以增强或修复LGPL组件。

LGPLv3 is not surprisingly easier to understand and examine from a compliance lens, since the FSF was influenced in LGPLv3's drafting by questions and comments on LGPLv2.1 over a period of years. Admittedly, LGPLv2.1 is still in wide use, and thus compliance with LGPLv2.1 remains a frequent topic you may encounter. The best advice there is careful study of Chapter [10.](#_bookmark147)

LGPLv3自然更易于从合规角度理解和审查，因为FSF在起草LGPLv3时受到了多年来关于LGPLv2.1的问题和评论的影响。值得注意的是，LGPLv2.1仍在广泛使用，因此遵守LGPLv2.1仍然是你可能遇到的频繁话题。最好的建议是仔细研究第10章。

However, to repeat a key point here made within that chapter: Note though that, since the LGPLv2.1 can be easily upgraded to GPLv2-or-later, in the worst case you simply need to comply as if the software was licensed under GPLv2. The only reason you must consider the question of whether you have a "work that uses the library" or a "work based on the library" is when you wish to take advantage of the "weak copyleft" effect of the Lesser GPL. If GPLv2-or-later is an acceptable license (i.e., if you plan to copyleft the entire work anyway), you may find this an easier option.

然而，重复一下该章节中的一个关键观点：请注意，由于LGPLv2.1可以轻松升级为GPLv2或更高版本，在最坏的情况下，你只需要按照软件受GPLv2许可证的规定来遵守。你必须考虑是否有一个“使用该库的工作”或者“基于该库的工作”的问题的

### 18.2 Upstream Providers

### 18.2 上游供应商

With ever-increasing frequency, software development (particularly for embedded devices) is outsourced to third parties. If you rely on an upstream provider for your software, note that you *cannot ignore your GPL* *compliance requirements* simply because someone else packaged the software that you distribute. If you redistribute GPL'd software (which you do, whenever you ship a device with your upstream's software in it), you are bound by the terms of the GPL. No distribution (including redistribution) is permissible absent adherence to the license terms.

越来越多的情况下，软件开发（尤其是嵌入式设备）被外包给第三方。如果你依赖上游供应商提供的软件，请注意，你不能仅因为别人打包了你分发的软件，就忽略你的GPL合规要求。如果你重新分发GPL的软件（每当你将设备带着上游提供的软件发货时，你就在重新分发），你就必须遵守GPL的条款。在未遵守许可证条款的情况下，没有任何分发（包括重新分发）是可行的。

Therefore, you should introduce a due diligence process into your software acquisition plans. This is much like the software-oriented recommendations we make in [14.](#_bookmark176) Implementing practices to ensure that you are aware of what software is in your devices can only improve your general business processes. You should ask a clear list of questions of all your upstream providers and make sure the answers are complete and accurate. The following are examples of questions you should ask:

因此，你应该在你的软件获取计划中引入尽职调查流程。这很像我们在14章中提出的面向软件的建议。采取实践来确保你了解设备中的软件内容，只能提高你的一般业务流程。你应该向所有的上游供应商提出一系列明确的问题，并确保回答完整准确。以下是你应该问的问题示例：

- What are all the licenses that cover the software in this device?

- From which upstream vendors, be they companies or individuals, did *you* receive your software before distributing it to us?

- What are your GPL compliance procedures?

- If there is GPL'd software in your distribution, we will be redistributors of this GPL'd software. What mechanisms do you have in place to aid us with compliance?

- If we follow your recommended compliance procedures, will you formally indemnify us in case we are nonetheless found to be in violation of the GPL?

- 该设备中涵盖的软件的所有许可证是什么？

- 你在将软件分发给我们之前从哪些上游供应商（无论是公司还是个人）处获得了你的软件？

- 你的GPL合规程序是什么？

- 如果你的分发中有GPL的软件，我们将成为这个GPL的软件的重新分发者。你有哪些机制来帮助我们合规？

- 如果我们遵循你推荐的合规程序，你是否会正式赔偿我们，以防我们仍然被发现违反GPL？

This last point is particularly important. Many GPL enforcement actions are escalated because of petty finger-pointing between the distributor and its upstream. In our experience, agreements regarding GPL compliance issues and procedures are rarely negotiated up front. However, when they are, violations are resolved much more smoothly (at least from the point of view of the redistributor).

最后一个问题尤其重要。许多GPL执法行动由于分销商和其上游供应商之间的琐碎指责而升级。根据我们的经验，在GPL合规问题和程序方面达成协议是很少提前谈判的。然而，当这样做时，违规处理更加顺畅（至少从再分销商的角度来看）。

Consider the cost of potential violations in your acquisition process. Using Free Software allows software vendors to reduce costs significantly, but be wary of vendors who have done so without regard for the licenses. If your vendor's costs seem "too good to be true," you may ultimately bear the burden of the vendor's inattention to GPL compliance. Ask the right questions, demand an account of your vendors' compliance procedures, and seek indemnity from them.

在你的采购过程中考虑潜在违规的成本。使用自由软件可以显著降低软件供应商的成本，但要警惕那些没有考虑许可证的供应商。如果你的供应商成本看起来“太好了”，最终你可能会承担供应商对GPL合规的忽视的负担。问对问题，要求供应商说明其合规程序，并向他们索取赔偿。

In particular, any time your vendor incorporates copylefted software, you *must* exercise your own rights as a user to request CCS for all the copylefted programs that your suppliers provided to you. Furthermore, you must ensure that CCS is correct and adequate yourself. Good vendors should help you do this, and make it easy. If those vendors cannot, pick a different vendor before proceeding with the product.

特别是当你的供应商使用具有版权保护的自由软件时，你必须行使自己作为用户的权利，要求所有供应商提供给你的受版权保护的程序的完整、正确的源代码。此外，你必须自己确保源代码是正确的和充分的。好的供应商应该帮助你做到这一点，并使其变得简单。如果供应商无法提供这样的帮助，请在继续使用该产品之前选择另一个供应商。

### 18.3 Mergers and Acquisitions

### 18.3 合并与收购

Often, larger companies often encounter copyleft licensing during a Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) process. Ultimately, a merger or acquisition causes all of the other company's problems to become yours. Therefore, for most concerns, the acquirer "simply" must apply the compliance analysis and methodologies discussed earlier across the acquired company's entire product line. Of course, this is not so simple, as such effort may be substantial, but a well-defined process for compliance investigation means the required work, while voluminous, is likely rote.

在合并和收购（M&A）过程中，大公司通常会遇到知识共享许可证。最终，合并或收购会导致所有其他公司的问题成为你的问题。因此，对于大多数问题，收购者“只需”在收购公司的整个产品线上应用先前讨论的合规分析和方法。当然，这并不是那么简单，因为这样的努力可能是重大的，但是明确定义的合规调查流程意味着所需的工作虽然繁重，但很可能是例行公事。

A few sections of GPL require careful attention and legal analysis to determine the risk of acquisitions. Those handling M&A issues should pay particular attention to the requirements of GPLv2 7 and GPLv3 10-- 12 --- focusing on how they relate to the acquired assets may be of particular importance.

GPL的几个部分需要仔细关注和法律分析，以确定收购的风险。处理M&A问题的人员应特别注意GPLv2 第7条和GPLv3 第10 - 12条的要求——重点关注它们与所收购资产的关系可能是特别重要的。

For example, GPLv3 10 clarifies that in business acquisitions, whether by sale of assets or transfers of control, the acquiring party is downstream from the party acquired. This results in new automatic downstream licenses from upstream copyright holders, licenses to all modifications made by the acquired business, and rights to source code provisioning for the now-downstream purchaser. However, despite this aid given by explicit language in GPLv3, acquirers must still confirm compliance by the acquired (even if GPLv3 10 does assert the the acquirers rights under GPL, that does not help if the acquired is out of compliance altogether). Furthermore, for fear of later reprisal by the acquirer if a GPL violation is later discovered in the acquired's product line, the acquired may need to seek a waiver and release of from additional damages beyond a requirement to comply fully (and a promise of rights restoration) if a GPL violation by the acquired is later uncovered during completion of the acquisition or thereafter.

例如，GPLv3 第10条澄清，在商业收购中，无论是通过资产销售还是控制权转移，收购方都位于被收购方的下游。这导致上游版权持有人向下游自动授予新的下游许可证，授予所有被收购企业所做的修改的许可证，并为现在的下游购买者提供源代码供应的权利。然而，尽管GPLv3明确语言为收购者提供了帮助，但收购者仍必须确认被收购方的合规性（即使GPLv3 第10条确实声明了收购者在GPL下的权利，如果被收购方完全不合规，则这并不能帮助到收购者）。此外，由于担心被收购方的产品线中以后发现GPL违规行为会导致收购者以后受到报复，被收购方可能需要寻求豁免并免除额外的损害赔偿要求，除了完全遵守（并承诺恢复权利）的要求外，如果收购方的GPL违规行为在完成收购或之后被发现，就需要这样做。

Finally, other advice available regarding handling of GPL compliance in an M&A situation tends to ignore the most important issue: most essential copylefted software is not wholly copyrighted by the entities involved in the M&A transaction. Therefore, copyleft obligations likely reach out to the customers of all entities involved, as well as to the original copyright holders of the copylefted work. As such, notwithstanding the two paragraphs in GPLv3 10, the entities involved in M&A should read the copyleft licenses through the lens of third parties whose software freedom rights under those licenses are of equal importance to then entities inside the transaction.

在 M&A 情况下处理 GPL 合规的其他可用建议往往忽略了最重要的问题：大多数重要的共享软件并非完全由 M&A 交易涉及的实体拥有版权。因此，共享义务可能会延伸到所有实体客户，以及共享作品的原始版权持有人。因此，尽管 GPLv3 第10条中有两段话，但 M&A 中涉及的实体应该通过第三方的视角阅读共享许可证，这些第三方的软件自由权利在这些许可证下与交易内部实体的权利同等重要。

### 18.4 User Products and Installation Information

### 18.4 用户产品和安装信息

GPLv3 requires you to provide "Installation Information" when v3 software is distributed in a "User Product." During the drafting of v3, the debate over this requirement was contentious. However, the provision as it appears in the final license is reasonable and easy to understand.

GPLv3要求在分发“用户产品”中的v3软件时提供“安装信息”。在v3起草期间，对此要求的争论很激烈。然而，在最终许可证中出现的规定是合理且易于理解的。

If you put GPLv3'd software into a User Product (as defined by the license) and *you* have the ability to install modified versions onto that device, you must provide information that makes it possible for the user to install functioning, modified versions of the software. Note that if no one, including you, can install a modified version, this provision does not apply. For example, if the software is burned onto an non-field- upgradable ROM chip, and the only way that chip can be upgraded is by producing a new one via a hardware factory process, then it is acceptable that the users cannot electronically upgrade the software themselves.

如果你将GPLv3的软件放入用户产品中（根据许可证的定义），并且你有能力将修改版安装到该设备上，你必须提供信息，使用户能够安装功能齐全的修改版软件。请注意，如果没有人（包括你在内）能够安装修改版，这项规定就不适用。例如，如果软件被烧录到不可升级的ROM芯片上，唯一的升级方式是通过硬件工厂流程制造新芯片，那么用户无法电子升级软件本身是可以接受的。

Furthermore, you are permitted to refuse support service, warranties, and software updates to a user who has installed a modified version. You may even forbid network access to devices that behave out of speci- fication due to such modifications. Indeed, this permission fits clearly with usual industry practice. While it is impossible to provide a device that is completely unmodifiable[^18-1^], users are generally on notice that they risk voiding their warranties and losing their update and support services when they make modifications.[^18-1^]

此外，你被允许拒绝向安装修改版的用户提供支持服务、保修和软件更新。你甚至可以禁止因此类修改而出现规格不符的设备访问网络。事实上，这个许可与通常的行业惯例完全相符。虽然无法提供完全不可修改的设备[^18-1^]，但用户通常会注意到，当他们进行修改时，他们冒着使保修失效和失去更新和支持服务的风险。[^18-2^]

GPLv3 is in many ways better for distributors who seek some degree of device lock-down. Technical processes are always found for subverting any lock-down; pursuing it is a losing battle regardless. With GPLv3, unlike with GPLv2, the license gives you clear provisions that you can rely on when you are forced to cut off support, service or warranty for a customer who has chosen to modify.

GPLv3在许多方面对寻求某种程度的设备锁定的分发商更为有利。技术过程总是被发现用于颠覆任何锁定；追求这一点总是徒劳无功的。与GPLv2不同，GPLv3许可证在你被迫切断为已选择修改的客户提供支持、服务或保修时，为你提供了清晰的规定。

### 18.5 Beware The Consultant in Enforcers' Clothing

### 18.5 注意扮成执法者的顾问

There are admittedly portions of the GPL enforcement community that function somewhat like the [computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28computer_security%29#Classifications) [security and network penetration testing hacker community.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28computer_security%29#Classifications) By analogy, most COGEO's consider themselves [white hats,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hat_%28computer_security%29) while some might appropriately call [proprietary relicensing](#business-models) by the name ["black](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28computer_security%29#Black_hat) hats". And, to finalize the analogy, there are indeed few [grey hat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_hat) GPL enforcers.

公开执法GPL的社区中，有一部分确实像计算机安全和网络渗透测试黑客社区一样运作。类比地，大多数COGEO认为自己是“白帽子”，而一些人可能恰当地将“专有重新许可”称为“黑帽子”。此外，确实有一些灰帽GPL执法者。

Grey hat GPL enforcers usually have done some community-oriented GPL enforcement themselves, typ- ically working as a volunteer for a COGEO, but make their living as a "hired gun" consultant to find GPL violations and offer to "fix them" for companies. Other such operators hold copyrights in some key piece of copylefted software and enforce as a mechanism to find out who is most likely to fund improvements on the software.

灰帽GPL执法者通常已经自己进行过一些面向社区的GPL执行，通常作为COGEO的志愿者工作，但他们通过作为“聘用枪手”顾问为公司寻找GPL违规行为并提供“修复”服务谋生。其他类似的运营商拥有某些关键的copylefted软件的版权，并强制执行以了解谁最有可能为软件改进提供资金。

A few companies report that they have formed beneficial consulting or employment relationships with developers they first encountered through enforcement. In some such cases, companies have worked with such consultants to alter the mode of use of the project's code in the company's products. More often in these cases, the communication channels opened in the course of the inquiry served other consulting purposes later.

一些公司报告称，他们已经与通过执行遇到的开发人员建立了有益的咨询或雇佣关系。在某些这样的情况下，公司已经与这些顾问合作，以改变项目代码在公司产品中的使用方式。在这些情况下，更多的是，在调查过程中开放的通信渠道后来为其他咨询目的服务。

[^18-1^]: Consider that the iPhone, a device designed primarily to restrict users' freedom to modify it, was unlocked and modified within 48 hours of its release.

[^18-1^]: 考虑到iPhone是一个旨在限制用户修改的设备，但是它在发布后的48小时内被解锁和修改。

[^18-2^]: A popular t-shirt in the software freedom community reads: "I void warranties.". Our community is well-known for modifying products with full knowledge of the consequences. GPLv3's "Installation Instructions" section merely confirms that reality, and makes sure GPL rights can be fully exercised, even if users exercise those rights at their own peril.

[^18-2^]: 软件自由社区流行的一款 T 恤衫上写着：“我无视保修条款”。我们的社区以全面了解后果的方式来修改产品而闻名。GPLv3 的“安装说明”部分仅仅确认了这一事实，并确保即使用户冒着自己的风险行使这些权利，GPL 的权利也能够被充分行使。

Feelings and opinions about this behavior are mixed within the larger copyleft community. Some see it as a reasonable business model and others renounce it as corrupt behavior. Regardless, a GPL violator should always immediately determine the motivations of the enforcer via documented, verifiable facts. For example, COGEOs such as the FSF and Conservancy have made substantial public commitments to enforce in a way that is uniform, transparent, and publicly documented. Furthermore, since these specific organizations are public charities in the USA, they are accountable to the IRS (and the public at large) in their annual Form 990 filings. Everyone may examine their revenue models and scrutinize their work.

在更广泛的copyleft社区中，人们对这种行为的感受和意见是各不相同的。有些人认为这是一个合理的商业模式，而另一些人则谴责它是腐败行为。无论如何，GPL违规者应该始终通过有文件记录的可验证事实来确定执法者的动机。例如，像自由软件基金会（FSF）和保护协会这样的COGEO已经做出了重大的公开承诺，以一种统一、透明和公开记录的方式进行执法。此外，由于这些特定组织是美国的公共慈善机构，它们在年度990表申报中对IRS（以及公众）负责。每个人都可以审查它们的收入模型和审查它们的工作。

However, entities and individuals who do GPL enforcement centered primarily around a profit motive are likely the most dangerous enforcement entities for one simple reason: an agreement to comply fully with the GPL for past and future products --- always the paramount goal to COGEOs --- may not suffice as adequate resolution for a proprietary relicensing company or grey hat GPL enforcer. Therefore, violators must consider carefully who has made the enforcement inquiry and ask when and where the enforcer made public commitments and reports regarding their enforcement work and perhaps even ask the enforcer to directly mimic CEOGEO's detailed public disclosures and follow the [standard requests for resolution](#_bookmark209) found in this document.

然而，以盈利为中心的GPL执法实体和个人可能是最危险的执法实体，原因很简单：对于一个专门进行专有再许可的公司或灰帽GPL执法者而言，完全遵守过去和未来产品的GPL协议可能不足以作为充分的解决方案。因此，违规者必须仔细考虑谁进行了执法调查，并询问执法者何时何地作出公开承诺和报告其执法工作，甚至可以要求执法者直接模仿COGEO的详细公开披露并遵循本文档中找到的标准解决请求。
