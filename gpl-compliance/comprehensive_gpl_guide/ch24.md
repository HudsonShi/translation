## 第24章 Vigorien：安全、出口管制和GPL合规性

This case study introduces how concerns of "security through obscurity" and regulatory problems can impact GPL compliance matters.

本案例研究介绍了"安全通过混淆"和法规问题如何影响GPL合规问题。

### 24.1 The Facts

### 24.1 事实

Vigorien distributes a back-up solution product that allows system administrators to create encrypted back- ups of file-systems on Unix-like computers. The product is based on GNU tar, a backup utility that replaces the standard Unix utility simply called tar, but has additional features.

Vigorien分发一款备份解决方案产品，使系统管理员能够在类Unix计算机上创建加密备份文件系统。该产品基于GNU tar，这是一种备份实用程序，可以替换称为tar的标准Unix实用程序，并具有其他功能。

Vigorien's backup solution added cryptographic features to GNU tar, and included a suite of utilities and graphical user interfaces surrounding GNU tar to make backups convenient.

Vigorien分发一款备份解决方案产品，使系统管理员能够在类Unix计算机上创建加密备份文件系统。该产品基于GNU tar，这是一种备份实用程序，可以替换称为tar的标准Unix实用程序，并具有其他功能。

FSF discovered the violation from a user report, and determined that the cryptographic features were the only part of the product that constituted a derivative work of GNU tar; the extraneous utilities merely made shell calls out to GNU tar. FSF requested that Vigorien come into compliance with the GPL by releasing the source of GNU tar, with the cryptographic modifications, to its customers.

FSF从用户报告中发现了这一违规行为，并确定加密功能是该产品中唯一构成GNU tar衍生作品的部分；多余的实用程序只是向GNU tar发出shell调用。FSF要求Vigorien通过向其客户发布带有加密修改的GNU tar源代码来符合GPL。

Vigorien released the original GNU tar sources, but kept the cryptographic modifications proprietary. They argued that the security of their system depending on keeping the software proprietary and that regardless, USA export restrictions on cryptographic software prohibited such a release. FSF disputed the first claim, pointing out that Vigorien had only one option if they did not want to release the source: they would have to remove GNU tar from the software and not distribute it further. Vigorien rejected this suggestion, since GNU tar was an integral part of the product, and the security changes were useless without GNU tar.

Vigorien发布了原始的GNU tar源代码，但保留了加密修改的专有权利。他们认为，系统的安全性取决于保持软件的专有性，并且无论如何，美国对加密软件的出口限制禁止这样的发布。FSF对第一项声明表示异议，指出如果他们不想发布源代码，只有一个选择：他们必须从软件中删除GNU tar，并不再分发它。Vigorien拒绝了这个建议，因为GNU tar是产品的一个重要组成部分，而没有GNU tar，安全更改是无用的。

Regarding the export control claims, FSF proposed a number of options, including release of the source from one of Vigorien's divisions overseas where no such restrictions occurred, but Vigorien argued that the problem was insoluble because they operated primarily in the USA.

关于出口控制的说法，FSF提出了许多选项，包括从Vigorien在没有此类限制的海外分支之一发布源代码，但Vigorien认为问题是无法解决的，因为他们主要在美国运营。

The deadlock on the second issue was resolved when those cryptographic export restrictions were lifted shortly thereafter, and FSF again raised the matter with Vigorien. At that point, they dropped the first claim and agreed to release the remaining source module to their customers. They did so, and the violation was resolved.

第二个问题的僵局在加密出口限制不久后解决，此后FSF再次向Vigorien提出了这个问题。此时，他们放弃了第一个声明，并同意向其客户发布剩余的源代码模块。他们这样做了，违规行为得到了解决。

### 24.2 Lessons Learned

### 24.2 教训

1. **Removing the GPL'd portion of the product is always an option.** Many violators' first response is to simply refuse to release the source code as the GPL requires. FSF offers the option to simply remove the GPL'd portions from the product and continue along without them. Every case where this has been suggested has led to the same conclusion. Like Vigorien, the violator argues that the product cannot function without the GPL'd components, and they cannot effectively replace them.

Such an outcome is simply further evidence that the combined work in question is indeed a modified version of the original GPL'd component. If the other components cannot stand on their own and be useful without the GPL'd portions, then one cannot effectively argue that the work as a whole is not a based on the GPL'd portions.

2. **The whole product is not always covered.** In this case, Vigorien had additional works aggregated. The backup system was a suite of utilities, some of which were the GPL and some of which were not. While the cryptographic routines were tightly coupled with GNU tar and clearly made a whole new combined work of both components, the various GUI utilities were separate and independent works merely aggregated with the distribution of the GNU-tar-based product.

3. **"Security" concerns do not exonerate a distributor from GPL obligations, and "security through obscurity" does not work anyway.** The argument that "this is security software, so it cannot be released in source form" is not a valid defense for explaining why the terms of the GPL are ignored. If companies do not want to release source code for some reason, then they should not base the work on GPL'd software. No external argument for noncompliance can hold weight if the work as a whole is indeed a modified version of a GPL'd program.

The "security concerns" argument is often floated as a reason to keep software proprietary, but the computer security community has on numerous occasions confirmed that such arguments are entirely specious. Security experts have found --- since the beginnings of the field of cryptography in the ancient world --- that sharing results about systems and having such systems withstand peer review and scrutiny builds the most secure systems. While full disclosure may help some who wish to compromise security, it helps those who want to fix problems even more by identifying them early.

4. **External regulatory problems can be difficult to resolve.** The GPL, though grounded in copyright law, does not have the power to trump regulations like export controls. While Vigorien's "security concerns" were specious, their export control concerns were not. It is indeed a difficult problem that FSF acknowledges. We want compliance with the GPL and respect for users' freedoms, but we certainly do not expect companies to commit criminal offenses for the sake of compliance. We will see more about this issue in our next case study.

1. **移除产品中受GPL保护的部分始终是一种选择。** 许多违规者的第一反应是拒绝按照GPL要求发布源代码。FSF提供了一种简单的解决方案，即从产品中简单地移除受GPL保护的部分，然后继续使用其他部分。每个这样建议的案例都导致了相同的结论。就像Vigorien一样，违规者辩称，如果没有GPL保护的组件，产品无法正常运行，并且他们无法有效地替换它们。

这样的结果仅仅进一步证明，涉及的组合作品确实是原始GPL组件的修改版本。如果其他组件不能独立运行且没有GPL的部分有用，则不能有效地主张整个作品不是基于GPL组件的。

2. **整个产品并不总是被覆盖。** 在这种情况下，Vigorien还有其他聚合的作品。备份系统是一套实用工具，其中一些是GPL，一些不是。虽然加密例程与GNU tar紧密耦合，并明显形成了GNU-tar-based产品的全新组合作品，但各种GUI实用程序是单独和独立的作品，仅仅是与分发GNU-tar-based产品的聚合。

3. **“安全”问题不能使分发者免除GPL义务。**“通过模糊来保护安全性”也行不通。“这是安全软件，因此不能以源代码形式发布”这种论点不是一个有效的辩护理由，解释为什么忽略了GPL的条款。如果公司出于某种原因不想发布源代码，那么他们就不应该以GPL软件为基础进行开发。如果整个作品确实是GPL软件的修改版本，那么任何非遵守的外部论点都没有说服力。

“安全问题”论点经常被提出作为保持软件专有的理由，但是计算机安全社区在许多场合证实，这种论点完全是无稽之谈。自古代密码学领域以来，安全专家们已经发现，共享关于系统的结果，并让这些系统经受同行评审和审查，构建最安全的系统。虽然完全披露可能有助于一些想要破坏安全的人，但它更有助于那些想要尽早识别问题并修复它们的人。

4. **外部监管问题可能难以解决。**尽管GPL是基于版权法的，但它无法取代出口管制等法规。尽管Vigorien的“安全担忧”是牵强的，但他们的出口管制担忧并非如此。这确实是一个FSF承认的难题。我们希望遵守GPL并尊重用户的自由，但我们肯定不希望公司为了遵守GPL而犯罪。我们将在下一个案例研究中详细了解这个问题。
