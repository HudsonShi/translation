# Part II A Practical Guide to GPL Compliance

# 第2部分 GPL 合规实用指南

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 概要

This is a guide to effective compliance with the GNU General Public License (GPL) and related licenses. Copyleft advocates usually seek to assist the community with GPL compliance cooperatively. This guide focuses on complying from the start, so that readers can learn to avoid enforcement actions entirely, or, at least, minimize the negative impact when enforcement actions occur. This guide introduces and explains basic legal concepts related to the GPL and its enforcement by copyright holders. It also outlines business practices and methods that lead to better GPL compliance. Finally, it recommends proper post-violation responses to the concerns of copyright holders.

这是一份有关有效遵守GNU通用公共许可证(GPL)和相关许可证的指南。Copyleft倡导者通常希望通过合作来协助社区进行GPL合规。本指南侧重于从一开始就合规，以便读者可以学习避免完全执行行动，或者至少在执行行动发生时将负面影响最小化。本指南介绍并解释与GPL及其版权持有者的执行相关的基本法律概念。它还概述了导致更好的GPL合规的业务实践和方法。最后，它建议适当的违规后应对版权持有者的关切的措施。

## CHAPTER 13 BACKGROUND

## 第13章 背景

Copyright law grants exclusive rights to authors. Authors who chose copyleft seek to protect the freedom of users and developers to copy, share, modify and redistribute the software. However, copyleft is ultimately implemented through copyright, and the GPL is primarily and by default a copyright license. (See [1.2](#how-does-software-become-free) for more about the interaction between copyright and copyleft.) Copyright law grants an unnatural exclusive control to copyright holders regarding copyright-controlled permissions related to the work. Therefore, copyright holders (or their agents) are the ultimately the sole authorities to enforce copyleft and protect the rights of users. Actions for copyright infringement are the ultimate legal mechanism for enforcement. Therefore, copyright holders, or collaborative groups of copyright holders, have historically been the actors in GPL enforcement.

版权法授予作者独占权利。选择使用copyleft的作者试图保护用户和开发人员复制、分享、修改和重新分发软件的自由。然而，copyleft最终是通过版权实施的，而GPL主要且默认是一种版权许可证。（有关版权和copyleft之间相互作用的更多信息，请参见[1.2](＃how-does-software-become-free)。）版权法在涉及作品的版权受控权限方面授予版权持有人不自然的独占控制。因此，版权持有人（或其代理人）最终是唯一的权力机构，用于执行copyleft并保护用户的权利。版权侵权行为是执行的最终法律机制。因此，版权持有人或版权持有人的协作团体在GPL执行中一直是行动者。

The earliest of these efforts began soon after the GPL was written by Richard M. Stallman (RMS) in 1989, and consisted of informal community efforts, often in public Usenet discussions.[^13-1^] Over the next decade, the Free Software Foundation (FSF), which holds copyrights in many GNU programs, was the only visible entity actively enforcing its GPL'd copyrights on behalf of the software freedom community. FSF's enforcement was generally a private process; the FSF contacted violators confidentially and helped them to comply with the license. Most violations were pursued this way until the early 2000's.

最早的这些努力始于1989年Richard M. Stallman（RMS）撰写的GPL之后不久，这些努力由非正式的社区努力组成，通常在公共的Usenet讨论中进行。[^13-1^] 在接下来的十年中，自由软件基金会（FSF）在为软件自由社区代表其GPL版权方面是唯一一个可见的实体。FSF的执行通常是一个私人流程；FSF会与侵权者进行保密联系，并帮助他们遵守许可证。大多数侵权行为都是通过这种方式来处理的，直到2000年代初期。

By that time, Linux-based systems such as GNU/Linux and BusyBox/Linux had become very common, particularly in embedded devices such as wireless routers. During this period, public ridicule of violators in the press and on Internet fora supplemented ongoing private enforcement and increased pressure on businesses to comply. In 2003, the FSF formalized its efforts into the GPL Compliance Lab, increased the volume of enforcement, and built community coalitions to encourage copyright holders to together settle amicably with violators. Beginning in 2004, Harald Welte took a more organized public enforcement approach and launched [gpl-violations.org,](http://gpl-violations.org/) a website and mailing list for collecting reports of GPL violations. On the basis of these reports, Welte successfully pursued many enforcement actions in Europe, including formal legal action. Harald earns the permanent fame as the first copyright holder to bring legal action in a court regarding GPL compliance.

到那个时候，基于Linux的系统，例如GNU/Linux和BusyBox/Linux已经非常普遍，特别是在无线路由器等嵌入式设备中。在这段时间内，对违规者的公开嘲笑在新闻媒体和互联网论坛上进行，补充了正在进行的私人执法，并增加了对企业遵守许可证的压力。2003年，FSF将其努力正式组织成GPL合规实验室，增加了执行量，并建立社区联盟，鼓励版权持有者与侵权者友好地共同解决问题。从2004年开始，Harald Welte采取了更有组织的公开执行方法，并推出了 gpl-violations.org，这是一个收集GPL侵权报告的网站和邮件列表。在这些报告的基础上，Welte成功地在欧洲追究了许多执行行动，包括正式的法律行动。Harald因成为第一个在GPL合规方面在法院提起法律诉讼的版权持有人而永久获得了名声。

In 2007, two copyright holders in BusyBox, in conjunction with the Software Freedom Conservancy ("Conservancy"), filed the first copyright infringement lawsuit based on a violation of the GPL in the USA. While lawsuits are of course quite public, the vast majority of Conservancy's enforcement actions are resolved privately via cooperative communications with violators. As both FSF and Conservancy have worked to bring individual companies into compliance, both organizations have encountered numerous violations resulting from preventable problems such as inadequate attention to licensing of upstream software, misconceptions about the GPL's terms, and poor communication between software developers and their management. This document highlights these problems and describe best practices to encourage corporate Free Software users to reevaluate their approach to GPL'd software and avoid future violations.

2007年，BusyBox的两个版权持有人与软件自由保护协会（“协会”）一起，根据违反GPL的行为在美国提起了第一起版权侵权诉讼。虽然诉讼当然是相当公开的，但绝大多数协会的执法行动都是通过与侵权者的合作沟通私下解决的。由于FSF和协会都致力于使各个公司符合许可证，因此两个组织都遇到了许多违规问题，这些问题可以通过避免诸如不充分关注上游软件的许可证、对GPL条款的误解以及软件开发人员和他们的管理之间的沟通不良等问题而防止。本文强调了这些问题，并描述了最佳实践，以鼓励企业自由软件用户重新评估其对GPL软件的处理方式并避免未来的违规行为。

[^13-1^]: One example is the public outcry over NeXT's attempt to make the Objective-C front-end to GCC proprietary. RMS, in fact, handled this enforcement action personally and the Objective-C front-end is still part of upstream GCC today.

[^13-1^]: 其中一个例子是公众对NeXT试图使GCC的Objective-C前端专有化的强烈抗议。实际上，RMS亲自处理了这个执行行动，而Objective-C前端仍然是GCC上游的一部分至今。

Both FSF and Conservancy continue GPL enforcement and compliance efforts for software under the GPL, the GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL) and other copyleft licenses. In doing so, both organizations have found that most violations stem from a few common, avoidable mistakes. All copyleft advocates hope to educate the community of commercial distributors, redistributors, and resellers on how to avoid violations in the first place, and to respond adequately and appropriately when a violation occurs.

FSF和协会都继续对使用GPL、GNU Lesser Public License (LGPL)和其他copyleft许可证的软件进行执行和合规工作。在执行过程中，两个组织发现大多数违规行为都源于一些常见的可避免错误。所有copyleft的支持者都希望教育商业分发者、再分发者和转售商社区如何避免首次违规，并在发生违规时做出足够和适当的回应。

### 13.1 Who Has Compliance Obligations?

### 13.1 谁有合规义务？

All distributors of modified or unmodified versions of copylefted works unmodified versions of the works have compliance obligations. Common methods of modifying the works include innumerable common acts, such as:

所有分销修改或未修改的copyleft作品的分发者都有合规义务。修改作品的常见方法包括无数常见的行为，例如：

- embedding those works as executable copies into a device,

- 将这些作品作为可执行副本嵌入到设备中，

- transferring a digital copy of executable copies to someone else,

- 将可执行副本的数字副本转移给其他人，

- posting a patch to the copylefted software to a public mailing list.

- 将著佐权软件的补丁发布到公共邮件列表。

Such distributors have obligations to (at least) the users to whom they (or intermediary parties) distribute those copies. In some cases, distributors have obligations to third parties not directly receiving their distribution of the works (depending on the distributors chosen licensing options, as described later in [15.1).](#binary-distribution-permission) In addition, distributors have compliance obligations to upstream parties, such as preservation of reasonable legal notices embedded in the code, and appropriate labeling of modified versions.

这些分发者有义务向他们（或中间方）分发这些副本的用户（至少）承担责任。在某些情况下，分发者对未直接接收其作品分发的第三方也有义务（取决于分发者选择的许可选项，如稍后在15.1中所述）。此外，分发者还有向上游方的合规义务，例如保留代码中嵌入的合理法律声明，并适当标记修改版本。

Online service providers and distributors alike have other compliance obligations. In general, they must refrain from imposing any additional restrictions on downstream parties. Most typically, such compliance problems arise from "umbrella licenses:" EULAs, or sublicenses that restrict downstream users' rights under copyleft. (See [7.3](#gplv2-6-gpl-my-one-and-only) and [9.13).](#gplv3-10-explicit-downstream-license)

在线服务提供商和分发商都有其他的合规义务。通常来说，他们必须避免对下游方施加任何额外的限制。这种合规问题最常见的来源是“伞形许可证”：即限制下游用户在copyleft下享有的权利的最终用户许可协议（EULA）或子许可证。（详见7.3和9.13）。

Patent holders having claims reading on GPL'd works they distribute must refrain from enforcing those claims against parties to whom they distribute. Furthermore, patent holders holding copyrights on GPLv3'd works must further grant an explicit patent license for any patent claims reading on the version they dis- tributed, and therefore cannot enforce those specific patent claims against anyone making, using or selling a work based on their distributed version. All parties must refrain from acting as a provider of services or distributor of licensed works if they have accepted, or had imposed on them by judicial action, any legal conditions that would prevent them from meeting any obligation under GPL. (See *§* [7.5,](#gplv2-7-give-software-liberty-or-give-it-death) *§* [9.14](#gplv3-11-explicit-patent-licensing) and *§* [9.15.](#gplv3-12-familiar-as-gplv2-7)

在分发 GPL 的作品时具有专利权的人必须避免对他们分发的任何一方强制执行其专利权声明。此外，持有 GPLv3 的版权者还必须为其分发版本中与专利有关的任何专利声明明确授予专利许可，因此不能对任何基于其分发版本进行制作、使用或销售的人执行这些特定的专利声明。如果任何一方接受或由司法行为强制执行任何法律条件以阻止其履行 GPL 下的任何义务，则所有各方都必须避免充当服务提供者或许可作品的分发者。 (参见 7.5, 9.14 和 9.15.)

### 13.2 What Are The Risks of Non-Compliance?

### 13.2 不合规的风险是什么？

Copyleft experts have for decades observed a significant mismatch between the assumptions most businesses make about copyleft compliance and the realities. Possibly due to excessive marketing of proprietary tools and services from the for-profit compliance industry, businesses perennially focus on the wrong concerns. This tutorial seeks to educate those businesses about what actually goes wrong, what causes disputes, and how to resolve those disputes.

多年来，知识产权专家一直观察到，大多数企业对于版权许可合规性的假设与实际情况存在显著的不匹配。可能是由于盈利合规行业过度营销专有工具和服务，企业经常关注错误的问题。本教程旨在教育这些企业关注实际出现的问题、引发争议的原因以及如何解决这些争议。

Many businesses currently invest undue resources to avoid unlikely risks that have low historical incidence of occurrence and low cost of remediation, while leaving unmanaged the risks that have historically resulted in all the litigation and other adverse outcomes. For example, some "compliance industry"[^13-2^] vendors insist that great effort must be expended to carefully list, in the menus or manuals of embedded electronics products, copyright notices for every last copyright holder that contributed to the Free Software included in the product. While nearly all Free Software licenses, including copylefts like GPL, require preservation and display of copyright notices, failure to meet this specific requirement is trivially remedied. Therefore, businesses should spend just reasonable efforts to properly display copyright notices, and note that failure to do so is simply remedied: add the missing copyright notice!

许多企业目前投入过多的资源来避免那些历史上发生率低、补救成本低的不太可能发生的风险，而忽略了那些历史上导致所有诉讼和其他不利后果的风险。例如，一些“合规产业”[^13-2^] 的供应商坚持认为，必须付出极大努力，在嵌入式电子产品的菜单或手册中仔细列出每个为产品中的自由软件做出贡献的版权持有者的版权声明。虽然几乎所有的自由软件许可证，包括类似GPL的Copyleft，都要求保存和显示版权声明，但未能满足这一具体要求是很容易纠正的。因此，企业应该花费合理的努力来正确显示版权声明，并注意未能这样做的问题是很容易解决的：只需添加缺少的版权声明即可！

[^13-2^]: “Compliance industry” refers to third-party for-profit companies that market proprietary software tools and/or consulting services that purport to aid businesses with their Free Software license compliance obligations, such as those found in GPL and other copyleft licenses. This tutorial leaves the term in quotes throughout, primarily to communicate the skepticism most of this tutorial’s authors feel regarding the mere existence of this industry. Not only do copyleft advocates object on principle to proprietary software tools in general, and to their ironic use specifically to comply with copyleft, but also to the “compliance industry” vendors’ marketing messaging, which some copyleft advocates claim as a cause in the risk misassessments discussed herein. Bradley M. Kuhn, specifically, regularly uses the term “compliance industrial complex” to analogize the types of problems in this industry to those warned against in the phrase of origin.

[^13-2^]: “合规产业”是指营利性第三方公司，它们市场推广专有软件工具和/或咨询服务，声称能够帮助企业满足其自由软件许可证合规义务，例如 GPL 和其他 Copyleft 许可证中规定的义务。本教程在整个过程中都用带引号的方式使用了这个术语，主要是为了传达本教程的大部分作者对这个产业存在的怀疑。Copyleft 支持者不仅基于原则反对专有软件工具，特别是用来遵守 Copyleft 的，而且反对“合规产业”供应商的市场营销信息，一些 Copyleft 支持者认为这些信息是导致本教程中讨论的风险错误评估的原因之一。具体来说，Bradley M. Kuhn 经常使用“合规产业复合体”这个术语来类比这个产业中存在的问题与起源短语中所警告的问题类型。

### 13.3 Understanding Who's Enforcing

### 13.3 了解谁在执法

The mismatch between actual compliance risk and compliance risk management typically results from a misunderstanding of licensor intentions. For-profit businesses often err by assuming other actors have kindred motivations. The primary enforcers of the GPL, however, have goals that for-profit businesses will find strange and perhaps downright alien.

实际合规风险与合规风险管理之间的不匹配通常是由于对许可方意图的误解而导致的。营利性企业经常错误地假设其他参与者有类似的动机。然而，GPL的主要执行者的目标可能对营利性企业来说会感到奇怪，甚至完全陌生。

Specifically, community-oriented GPL enforcement organizations (called "COGEOs" throughout the re- mainder of this tutorial) are typically non-profit charities (such as the FSF and Software Freedom Conser- vancy) who declare, as part of their charitable mission, advancement of software freedom for all users. In the USA, these COGEOs are all classified as charitable under the IRS's 501(c)(3) designation, which is reserved for organizations that have a mission to enhance the public good.

具体来说，在这个教程的剩余部分中称为“COGEOs”的社区导向的GPL执法组织通常是非营利性慈善机构（例如FSF和软件自由保护协会），它们宣布作为其慈善使命，推进所有用户的软件自由。在美国，这些COGEOs都被归类为非营利性慈善机构，根据IRS的501(c)(3)规定，这种分类是为了那些旨在增进公共福利的组织而保留的。

As such, these COGEOs enforce GPL primarily to pursue the policy goals and motivations discussed throughout this tutorial: to spread software freedom further. As such, COGEOs are unified in their primary goal to bring the violator back into compliance as quickly as possible, and redress the damage caused by the violation. COGEOs are steadfast in their position in a violation negotiation: comply with the license and respect freedom.

因此，这些COGEOs主要通过执行GPL来追求本教程中讨论的政策目标和动机：进一步推广软件自由。因此，COGEOs在其主要目标上是一致的，即尽快将违规者带回遵守许可证的轨道，并补救违规造成的损害。在违规协商中，COGEOs坚定地主张：遵守许可证并尊重自由。

Certainly, other entities do not share the full ethos of software freedom as institutionalized by COGEOs, and those entities pursue GPL violations differently. Oracle, a company that produces the GPL'd MySQL database, upon discovering GPL violations typically negotiates a proprietary software license separately for a fee. While this practice is not one a COGEO would undertake nor endorse, a copyleft license technically permits this behavior. To put a finer point on this practice already discussed in [12.2,](#business-models) copyleft advocates usually find copyleft enforcement efforts focused on extract alternative proprietary licenses distasteful at best, and a corrupt manipulation of copyleft at worst. Much to the advocates' chagrin, such for-profit enforcement efforts seem to increase rather than decrease.

当然，其他机构并不完全分享COGEO所制定的软件自由理念，这些机构以不同的方式追究GPL违规行为。甲骨文公司是一个提供GPL的MySQL数据库的公司，发现GPL违规行为后通常会单独协商收费的专有软件许可证。虽然这种做法不是COGEO会采取或支持的做法，但著佐权许可证从技术上允许这种行为。更进一步地，正如在12.2中已经讨论过的这种做法，著佐权的倡导者通常认为，着重提取替代专有许可证的著佐权执法行动充其量令人不快，最坏的情况是对著佐权的腐败操纵。令倡导者感到烦恼的是，这样的营利性执法行动似乎越来越多，而不是减少。

Thus, unsurprisingly, for-profit adopters of GPL'd software often incorrectly assume that all copyright holders seek royalties. Businesses therefore focus on the risk of so-called "accidental" (typically as the result of unsupervised activity by individual programmers) infringe copyright by incorporating "snippets" of copylefted code into their own proprietary computer program. "Compliance industry" flagship products, therefore, focus on "code scanning" services that purport to detect accidental inclusions. Such effort focuses on proprietary software development and view Free Software as a foreign interloper. Such approach not only ignores current reality that many companies build their products directly on major copylefted projects (e.g., Android vendor's use of the kernel named Linux), but also creates a culture of fear among developers, leading them into a downward spiral of further hiding their necessary reliance on copylefted software in the company's products.

因此，毫不奇怪，采用GPL授权软件的营利企业通常会错误地认为所有版权持有人都寻求版税。因此，企业关注所谓的“意外”侵犯版权的风险（通常是由个人程序员的监管不足导致），他们将“片段”的通用公共授权代码合并到自己的专有计算机程序中。因此，“合规产业”的旗舰产品便集中于声称能够检测到这些意外合并的“代码扫描”服务。这种做法关注的是专有软件开发，并将自由软件视为一个外来者。这种方法不仅忽略了当前的现实情况，即许多公司直接在重要的通用公共授权项目（例如，Android供应商使用名为Linux的内核）上构建他们的产品，而且还在开发人员之间创造了一种恐惧文化，导致他们在公司产品中进一步隐藏其对通用公共授权软件的必要依赖。

Fortunately, COGEOs regard GPL compliance failures as an opportunity to improve compliance. Every compliance failure downstream represents a loss of rights by their users. The COGEOs are the guardian of its users' and developers' rights. Their activity seeks to restore those rights, and to protect the project's contributors' intentions in the making of their software.

幸运的是，COGEO（社区导向的GPL执行组织）将GPL合规失败视为提高合规性的机会。每一次合规失败都代表着用户失去了权利。COGEO是其用户和开发人员权利的守护者。他们的活动旨在恢复这些权利，并保护项目贡献者在制作软件时的意图。
