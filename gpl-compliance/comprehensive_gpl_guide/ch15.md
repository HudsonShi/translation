## CHAPTER 15 DETAILS OF COMPLIANT DISTRIBUTION

## 第15章 符合要求的发行

Distribution of GPL'd works has requirements; copyleft will not function without placing requirements on redistribution. However, some requirements are more likely to cause compliance difficult than others. This chapter[^1^](#_bookmark188) explains some the specific requirements placed upon distributors of GPL'd software that redistributors are most likely to overlook, yielding compliance problems.

分发GPL作品有要求；没有对再分发提出要求，共享版权也无法发挥作用。然而，有些要求比其他要求更容易导致符合要求的困难。本章^1^解释了针对GPL软件的分发商放置的一些具体要求，这些要求往往被再分发者忽视，从而导致符合要求的问题。

First, [GPLv2 1](#gplv2-1-verbatim-copying) and [GPLv2 4](#gplv2-4-termination-on-violation) require that the full license text must accompany every distribution (either in source or binary form) of each licensed work. Strangely, this requirement is responsible for a surprisingly significant fraction of compliance errors; too often, physical products lack required information about the presence of GPL'd programs and the applicable license terms. Automated build processes can and should carry a copy of the license from the the source distribution into the final binary firmware package for embedded products. Such automation usually achieves compliance regarding license inclusion requirements[^2^](#_bookmark189)

首先，GPLv2 1和GPLv2 4要求每个受许可工作的每个分发（无论是源代码还是二进制形式）必须附带完整的许可证文本。奇怪的是，这一要求导致了相当大比例的符合要求错误；太多的物理产品缺乏关于GPL程序的存在和适用许可证条款的必要信息。自动化的构建过程可以并且应该将许可证副本从源代码分发中携带到嵌入式产品的最终二进制固件包中。这种自动化通常可以达到符合许可证包含要求的要求^2^。
## Binary Distribution Permission

## 二进制分发许可

The various versions of the GPL are copyright licenses that grant permission to make certain uses of software that are otherwise restricted by copyright law. This permission is conditioned upon compliance with the GPL's requirements.

GPL的各个版本都是版权许可证，授权在版权法限制下进行某些软件使用。这个许可是有条件的，需要遵守GPL的要求。

This section walks through the requirements (of both GPLv2 and GPLv3) that apply when you distribute GPL'd programs in binary (i.e., executable or object code) form, which is typical for embedded applications. Because a binary application derives from a program's original sources, you need permission from the copy- right holder to distribute it. 3 of GPLv2 and 6 of GPLv3 contain the permissions and conditions related to binary distributions of GPL'd programs.[^3^](#_bookmark190) Failure to provide or offer CCS is the single largest failure mode leading to compliance disputes.

本节介绍了适用于以二进制形式（即可执行或目标代码）分发GPL程序时（这在嵌入式应用中很常见）的要求（适用于GPLv2和GPLv3）。因为二进制应用程序是从程序的原始源代码中派生出来的，因此您需要版权持有人的许可才能分发它。GPLv2的第3条和GPLv3的第6条包含了与GPL程序的二进制分发相关的许可和条件。^3^未能提供或提供CCS是导致合规争议的最大失败模式。

GPL's binary distribution sections offer a choice of compliance methods, each of which we consider in turn. Each option refers to the "Corresponding Source" code for the binary distribution, which includes the source code from which the binary was produced. This abbreviated and simplified definition is sufficient for the binary distribution discussion in this section, but you may wish to refer back to this section after reading the thorough discussion of "Corresponding Source" that appears in []{#_bookmark188 .anchor}*§* [15.2.](#preparing-corresponding-source)

GPL的二进制分发部分提供了几种合规方法选择，我们依次考虑每种选项。每个选项都涉及二进制分发的“相应源代码”，其中包括生成二进制代码的源代码。这个缩写和简化的定义足以在本节的二进制分发讨论中使用，但是您可能希望在阅读了出现在§15.2中的“相应源代码”的详细讨论后再参考本节。

^1^Note that this chapter refers heavily to specific provisions and language in [GPLv2 3](#_bookmark257) and [GPLv3 6.](#_bookmark260) It may be helpful to []{#_bookmark189 .anchor}review [5.2](#gplv2-3-producing-binaries) and [9.9](#gplv3-6-non-source-and-corresponding-source) first, and then have a copy of each license open while reading this section.

### Option (a): Source Alongside Binary

### 选项（a）：与二进制文件同时提供源代码

GPLv2 3(a) and v3 6(a) embody the easiest option for providing source code: including Corresponding Source with every binary distribution. While other options appear initially less onerous, this option invari- ably minimizes potential compliance problems, because when you distribute Corresponding Source with the binary, *your GPL obligations are satisfied at the time of distribution*. This is not true of other options, and for this reason, we urge you to seriously consider this option. If you do not, you may extend the duration of your obligations far beyond your last binary distribution.

GPLv2 3(a)和v3 6(a)体现了提供源代码最简单的选项：在每个二进制发布中包含相应的源代码。虽然其他选项最初似乎不那么麻烦，但这个选项不可避免地最大限度地减少了潜在的合规问题，因为当您将相应的源代码与二进制文件一起分发时，您的GPL义务在分发时就得到了满足。其他选项并非如此，因此我们敦促您认真考虑此选项。如果您不这样做，您可能会将您的义务延长到最后一个二进制分发之后。

Compliance under this option is straightforward. If you ship a product that includes binary copies of GPL'd software (e.g., in firmware, or on a hard drive, CD, or other permanent storage medium), you can store the Corresponding Source alongside the binaries. Alternatively, you can include the source on a CD or other removable storage medium in the box containing the product.

按照此选项的合规性很简单。如果您发布的产品包含GPL软件的二进制副本（例如在固件中或存储在硬盘驱动器、CD或其他永久存储介质上），则可以将相应的源代码与二进制文件一起存储。或者，您可以在产品所在的盒子里包含一个 CD 或其他可移动存储介质，上面包含源代码。

GPLv2 refers to the various storage mechanisms as "medi\[a\] customarily used for software interchange". While the Internet has attained primacy as a means of software distribution where super-fast Internet connections are available, GPLv2 was written at a time when downloading software was not practical (and was often impossible). For much of the world, this condition has not changed since GPLv2's publication, and the Internet still cannot be considered "a medium customary for software interchange". GPLv3 clarifies this matter, requiring that source be "fixed on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange". This language affirms that option (a) requires binary redistributors to provide source on a physical medium.

GPLv2将各种存储机制称为“软件交换习惯上使用的介质”。虽然在超快速互联网连接可用的情况下，互联网已经成为软件分发的主要手段，但GPLv2是在下载软件不可行（并且经常是不可能的）的时代编写的。对于世界上大部分地区而言，自GPLv2出版以来，这种情况并没有改变，因此互联网仍不能被视为“软件交换的常规介质”。GPLv3澄清了这一点，要求源代码“固定在常规用于软件交换的耐用物理介质上”。这种语言确认了选项（a）要求二进制再分发者在物理介质上提供源代码。

Please note that while selection of option (a) requires distribution on a physical medium, voluntary distribution via the Internet is very useful. This is discussed in detail in *§* [15.1.2.](#option-b-the-offer)

请注意，虽然选择选项（a）需要通过物理介质分发，但自愿通过互联网分发非常有用。这在*§* 15.1.2.中详细讨论。

### Option (b): The Offer

### 选项（b）：提供源代码

Many distributors prefer to ship only an offer for source with the binary distribution, rather than the complete source package. This option has value when the cost of source distribution is a true per-unit cost. For example, this option might be a good choice for embedded products with permanent storage too small to fit the source, and which are not otherwise shipped with a CD but *are* shipped with a manual or other printed material.

许多分发者更喜欢仅随二进制分发提供源代码的邀请，而不是完整的源代码包。当源代码分发成本是真正的单位成本时，这个选项是有价值的。例如，当嵌入式产品的永久存储空间太小无法容纳源代码，并且没有随盘（CD）或其他印刷材料一起发送时，这个选项可能是一个好的选择。

However, this option increases the duration of your obligations dramatically. An offer for source must be good for three full years from your last binary distribution (under GPLv2), or your last binary or spare part distribution (under GPLv3). Your source code request and provisioning system must be designed to last much longer than your product life cycle. Thus, it also increases your compliance costs in the long run. In addition, if you are required to comply with the terms of GPLv2, you **cannot** use a network service to provide the source code. For GPLv2, the source code offer is fulfilled only with physical media. This usually means that you must continue to produce an up-to-date "source code CD" for years after the product's end-of-life.

然而，这个选项会显著增加你的义务期限。根据GPLv2，源代码邀请必须在你的最后一个二进制分发之后保持三年有效期，或在GPLv3下，你的最后一个二进制或备件分发之后保持三年有效期。你的源代码请求和提供系统必须设计得比你的产品生命周期长得多。因此，它也会增加你长期的合规成本。此外，如果你需要遵守GPLv2的条款，则不能使用网络服务提供源代码。对于GPLv2，只有在实体媒介上提供源代码邀请才能履行义务。这通常意味着你必须在产品的生命周期结束后多年继续生产最新的“源代码CD”。

Under GPLv2, it is acceptable and advisable for your offer for source code to include an Internet link for downloadable source *in addition* to offering source on a physical medium. This practice enables those with fast network connections to get the source more quickly, and typically decreases the number of physical media fulfillment requests. (GPLv3 6(b) permits provision of source with a public network-accessible distribution only and no physical media. We discuss this in detail at the end of this section.)

根据GPLv2，你的源代码邀请可以包括可下载源代码的Internet链接，并且建议这么做，除了提供实体媒介的源代码。这种做法可以使那些拥有快速网络连接的人更快地获取源代码，并且通常会减少实体媒介履行请求的数量。（GPLv3 6(b)仅允许在公共网络可访问分发源代码，不提供实体媒介。我们在本节末尾详细讨论此问题。）

The following is a suggested compliant offer for source under GPLv2 (and is also acceptable for GPLv3) that you would include in your printed materials accompanying each binary distribution:

以下是在每个二进制分发品附带的印刷材料中建议的符合GPLv2（也适用于GPLv3）的源代码提供方案：

>The software included in this product contains copyrighted software that is licensed under the GPL. A copy of that license is included in this document on page *X*. You may obtain the complete Corresponding Source code from us for a period of three years after our last shipment of this product, which will be no earlier than 2011-08-01, by sending a money order or check for \$5 to:
>

>
>Please write "source for product *Y* " in the memo line of your payment.
>
>You may also find a copy of the source at <http://www.example.com/sources/Y/>. This offer is valid to anyone in receipt of this information.

>此产品中包含根据GPL许可的受版权保护的软件。该许可证的副本已包含在本文档的第X页中。您可以通过发送5美元的汇票或支票到以下地址，获得我们提供的该产品最后一次装运后三年内的完整的对应源代码：

>
>请在付款单的备忘录栏中写上“产品Y的源代码”。
>
>您还可以在 <http://www.example.com/sources/Y/> 找到源代码的副本。此提供方案适用于所有收到此信息的人。

There are a few important details about this offer. First, it requires a copying fee. GPLv2 permits "a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution". This fee must be reasonable. If your cost of copying and mailing a CD is more than around \$10, you should perhaps find a cheaper CD stock and shipment method. It is simply not in your interest to try to overcharge the community. Abuse of this provision in order to make a for-profit enterprise of source code provision will likely trigger enforcement action.

提供源代码有几个重要的细节。首先，要求授权费。GPLv2 授权你“收取不超过你实际分发源代码成本的费用”。收费必须合理。如果你复制和邮寄一张 CD 的费用超过10美元，你可能需要找更便宜的 CD 店和邮寄方式。简单来说，从社区盈利不是你的目的。滥用此条款建立靠源代码盈利的企业可能会引发执行行动。

Second, note that the last line makes the offer valid to anyone who requests the source. This is because v2 3(b) requires that offers be "to give any third party" a copy of the Corresponding Source. GPLv3 has a similar requirement, stating that an offer must be valid for "anyone who possesses the object code". These requirements indicated in v2 3(c) and v3 6(c) are so that noncommercial redistributors may pass these offers along with their distributions. Therefore, the offers must be valid not only to your customers, but also to anyone who received a copy of the binaries from them. Many distributors overlook this requirement and assume that they are only required to fulfill a request from their direct customers.

其次，注意最后一行规定了向任何要求源代码的人提供源代码都是有效的。这是因为第2版3(b)要求了向“任何第三方”提供相应源代码的副本。GPLv3 有相似的要求，声明了提供源代码必须是向“任何拥有目标代码的人”都是有效的。第2版 3(c) 和第3版 6(c) 中指出的这些要求是为了让非商业再分发者可以与他们的分发一起传递。 因此，提供源代码必须不仅对您的客户有效，而且对从他们那里收到二进制文件副本的任何人都必须有效。 许多分销商忽视了这一要求，并认为他们只需要满足直接客户的要求。

The option to provide an offer for source rather than direct source distribution is a special benefit to companies equipped to handle a fulfillment process. GPLv2 3(c) and GPLv3 6(c) avoid burdening noncommercial, occasional redistributors with fulfillment request obligations by allowing them to pass along the offer for source as they received it.

Note that commercial redistributors cannot avail themselves of the option (c) exception, and so while your offer for source must be good to anyone who receives the offer (under v2) or the object code (under v3), it *cannot* extinguish the obligations of anyone who commercially redistributes your product. The license terms apply to anyone who distributes GPL'd software, regardless of whether they are the original distributor. Take the example of Vendor *V* , who develops a software platform from GPL'd sources for use in embedded devices. Manufacturer *M* contracts with *V* to install the software as firmware in *M* 's device. *V* provides the software to *M* , along with a compliant offer for source. In this situation, *M* cannot simply pass *V* 's offer for source along to its customers. *M* also distributes the GPL'd software commercially, so *M* too must comply with the GPL and provide source (or *M* 's *own* offer for source) to *M* 's customers.

This situation illustrates that the offer for source is often a poor choice for products that your customers will likely redistribute. If you include the source itself with the products, then your distribution to your customers is compliant, and their (unmodified) distribution to their customers is likewise compliant, because both include source. If you include only an offer for source, your distribution is compliant but your customer's distribution does not "inherit" that compliance, because they have not made their own offer to accompany their distribution.

The terms related to the offer for source are quite different if you distribute under GPLv3. Under v3, you may make source available only over a network server, as long as it is available to the general public and remains active for three years from the last distribution of your product or related spare part. Accordingly, you may satisfy your fulfillment obligations via Internet-only distribution. This makes the "offer for source" option less troublesome for v3-only distributions, easing compliance for commercial redistributors. However, before you switch to a purely Internet-based fulfillment process, you must first confirm that you can actually distribute *all* of the software under GPLv3. Some programs are indeed licensed under "GPLv2, *or any later version*" (often abbreviated "GPLv2-or-later"). Such licensing gives you the option to redistribute under GPLv3. However, a few popular programs are only licensed under GPLv2 and not "or any later version" ("GPLv2-only"). You cannot provide only Internet-based source request fulfillment for the latter programs. If you determine that all GPL'd works in your whole product allow upgrade to GPLv3 (or were already

GPLv3'd to start), your offer for source may be as simple as this:

The software included in this product contains copyrighted software that is licensed under the GPLv3. A copy of that license is included in this document on page *X*. You may obtain the complete Corresponding Source code from us for a period of three years after our last shipment of this product and/or spare parts therefor, which will be no earlier than 2011-08-01, on our website at <http://www.example.com/sources/productnum/>.

Under both GPLv2 and GPLv3, source offers must be accompanied by a copy of the license itself, either electronically or in print, with every distribution.

Finally, it is unacceptable to use option (b) merely because you do not have Corresponding Source ready. We find that some companies choose this option because writing an offer is easy, but producing a source distribution as an afterthought to a hasty development process is difficult. The offer for source does not exist as a stop-gap solution for companies rushing to market with an out-of-compliance product. If you ship an offer for source with your product but cannot actually deliver *immediately* on that offer when your customers request it, you should expect an enforcement action.

### Option (c): Noncommercial Offers

As discussed in the last section, GPLv2 3(c) and GPLv3 6(c) apply only to noncommercial use. These options are not available to businesses distributing GPL'd software. Consequently, companies that redis- tribute software packaged for them by an upstream vendor cannot merely pass along the offer they received from the vendor; they must provide their own offer or corresponding source to their distributees. We talk in detail about upstream software providers in *§* [18.2.](#upstream-providers)

### Option 6(d) in GPLv3: Internet Distribution

Under GPLv2, your formal provisioning options for Corresponding Source ended with 3(c). But even under GPLv2, pure Internet source distribution was a common practice and generally considered to be compliant. GPLv2 mentions Internet-only distribution almost as aside in the language, in text at the end of the section after the three provisioning options are listed. To quote that part of GPLv2 *§* 3:

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

When that was written in 1991, Internet distribution of software was the exception, not the rule. Some FTP sites existed, but generally software was sent on magnetic tape or CDs. GPLv2 therefore mostly assumed that binary distribution happened on some physical media. By contrast, GPLv3 6(d) explicitly gives an option for this practice that the community has historically considered GPLv2-compliant.

Thus, you may fulfill your source-provision obligations by providing the source code in the same way and from the same location. When exercising this option, you are not obligated to ensure that users download the source when they download the binary, and you may use separate servers as needed to fulfill the requests as long as you make the source as accessible as the binary. However, you must ensure that users can easily find the source code at the time they download the binary. GPLv3 6(d) thus clarifies a point that has caused confusion about source provision in v2. Indeed, many such important clarifications are included in v3 which together provide a compelling reason for authors and redistributors alike to adopt GPLv3.

### Option 6(e) in GPLv3: Software Torrents

Peer-to-peer file sharing arose well after GPLv2 was written, and does not easily fit any of the v2 source provision options. GPLv3 6(e) addresses this issue, explicitly allowing for distribution of source and binary together on a peer-to-peer file sharing network. If you distribute solely via peer-to-peer networks, you can exercise this option. However, peer-to-peer source distribution *cannot* fulfill your source provision obligations for non-peer-to-peer binary distributions. Finally, you should ensure that binaries and source are equally seeded upon initial peer-to-peer distribution.

## Preparing Corresponding Source

Most enforcement cases involve companies that have unfortunately not implemented procedures like our [14](#_bookmark176) recommendations and have no source distribution arranged at all. These companies must work backwards from a binary distribution to come into compliance. Our recommendations in [14](#_bookmark176) are designed to make it easy to construct a complete and Corresponding Source release from the outset. If you have followed those principles in your development, you can meet the following requirements with ease. If you have not, you may have substantial reconstruction work to do.

### Assemble the Sources

For every binary that you produce, you should collect and maintain a copy of the sources from which it was built. A large system, such as an embedded firmware, will probably contain many GPL'd and LGPL'd components for which you will have to provide source. The binary distribution may also contain proprietary components which are separate and independent works that are covered by neither the GPL nor LGPL.

The best way to separate out your sources is to have a subdirectory for each component in your system. You can then easily mark some of them as required for your Corresponding Source releases. Collecting subdirectories of GPL'd and LGPL'd components is the first step toward preparing your release.

### Building the Sources

Few distributors, particularly of embedded systems, take care to read the actual definition of Corresponding Source in the GPL. Consider carefully the definition, from GPLv3:

>The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.

and the definition from GPLv2:

>The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable.

Note that you must include "scripts used to control compilation and installation of the executable" and/or anything "needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities". These phrases are written to cover different types of build environments and systems. Therefore, the details of what you need to provide with regard to scripts and installation instructions vary depending on the software details. You must provide all information necessary such that someone generally skilled with computer systems could produce a binary similar to the one provided.

Take as an example an embedded wireless device. Usually, a company distributes a firmware, which in- cludes a binary copy of Linux[^4^](#_bookmark199) and a filesystem. That filesystem contains various binary programs, including some GPL'd binaries, alongside some proprietary binaries that are separate works (i.e., not derived from, nor based on freely-licensed sources). Consider what, in this case, constitutes adequate "scripts to control compilation and installation" or items "needed to generate, install and run" the GPL'd programs.

Most importantly, you must provide some sort of roadmap that allows technically sophisticated users to build your software. This can be complicated in an embedded environment. If your developers use scripts to control the entire compilation and installation procedure, then you can simply provide those scripts to users along with the sources they act upon. Sometimes, however, scripts were never written (e.g., the information on how to build the binaries is locked up in the mind of your "build guru"). In that case, we recommend that you write out build instructions in a natural language as a detailed, step-by-step readme.

No matter what you offer, you need to give those who receive source a clear path from your sources to binaries similar to the ones you ship. If you ship a firmware (kernel plus filesystem), and the filesystem

^4^[]{#_bookmark199 .anchor}"Linux" refers only to the kernel, not the larger system as a whole.

contains binaries of GPL'd programs, then you should provide whatever is necessary to enable a reasonably skilled user to build any given GPL'd source program (and modified versions thereof), and replace the given binary in your filesystem. If the kernel is Linux, then the users must have the instructions to do the same with the kernel. The best way to achieve this is to make available to your users whatever scripts or process your engineers would use to do the same.

These are the general details for how installation instructions work. Details about what differs when the work is licensed under LGPL is discussed in *§* [18.1,](#lgpl-compliance) and specific details that are unique to GPLv3's installation instructions are in *§* [18.4.](#user-products-and-installation-information)

### What About the Compiler?

The GPL contains no provision that requires distribution of the compiler used to build the software. While companies are encouraged to make it as easy as possible for their users to build the sources, inclusion of the compiler itself is not normally considered mandatory. The Corresponding Source definition -- both in GPLv2 and GPLv3 -- has not been typically read to include the compiler itself, but rather
things like makefiles, build scripts, and packaging scripts.

Nonetheless, in the interest of goodwill and the spirit of the GPL, most companies do provide the compiler itself when they are able, particularly when the compiler is based on GCC or another copylefted compiler. If you have a GCC-based system, it is your prerogative to redistribute that GCC version (binaries plus sources) to your customers. We in the software freedom community encourage you to do this, since it often makes it easier for users to exercise their software freedom. However, if you chose to take this recommendation, ensure that your GCC distribution is itself compliant.

If you have used a proprietary, third-party compiler to build the software, then you probably cannot ship it to your customers. We consider the name of the compiler, its exact version number, and where it can be acquired as information that *must* be provided as part of the Corresponding Source. This information is essential to anyone who wishes to produce a binary. It is not the intent of the GPL to require you to distribute third-party software tools to your customer (provided the tools themselves are not based on the GPL'd software shipped), but we do believe it requires that you give the user all the essential non-proprietary facts that you had at your disposal to build the software. Therefore, if you choose not to distribute the compiler, you should include a readme about where you got it, what version it was, and who to contact to acquire it, regardless of whether your compiler is Free Software, proprietary, or internally developed.

## Best Practices and Corresponding Source

[14](#_bookmark176) and [15.2](#preparing-corresponding-source) above are closely related. If you follow the best practices outlined above, you will find that preparing your Corresponding Source release is an easier task, perhaps even a trivial one.

Indeed, the enforcement process itself has historically been useful to software development teams. Devel- opment on a deadline can lead organizations to cut corners in a way that negatively impacts its development processes. We have frequently been told by violators that they experience difficulty when determining the exact source for a binary in production (in some cases because their "build guru" quit during the release cycle). When management rushes a development team to ship a release, they are less likely to keep release sources tagged and build systems well documented.

We suggest that, if contacted about a violation, product builders use GPL enforcement as an opportunity to improve their development practices. No developer would argue that their system is better for having a mysterious build system and no source tracking. Address these issues by installing a revision system, telling your developers to use it, and requiring your build guru to document his or her work!

## Non-Technical Compliance Issues

Certainly, the overwhelming majority of compliance issues are, in fact, either procedural or technical. Thus, the primary material in this chapter so far has covered those issues. However, a few compliance issues do require more direct consideration of a legal situation. This portion guide does not consider those in detail, as a careful reading of the earlier chapters of Part [I](#_bookmark1) shows various places where legal considerations are necessary for considering compliance activity.

For example, specific compliance issues related to [GPLv2 7,](#gplv2-7-give-software-liberty-or-give-it-death) [GPLv3 7,](#gplv3-7-additional-permissions) and [GPLv3 11](#gplv3-7-additional-permissions) demand a more traditional approach to legal license compliance. Of course, such analysis and consideration can be com- plicated, and some are considered in the enforcement case studies that follow in the next part. However, compliance issues related to such sections are not rare, and, as is typical, no specific training is available for dealing with extremely rare occurrences.

## Self-Assessment of Compliance

Most companies that adopt copylefted software believe they have complied. Humans usually have difficult admitting their own mistakes, particularly systematic ones. Therefore, perhaps the most important necessary step to stay in compliance is a company's regular evaluation of their own compliance.

First, exercise a request CCS for all copylefted works from all your upstream providers of software and of components embedding software. Then, perform your own CCS check on this material first, and verify that it meets the requirements. This tutorial presents later a case study of a COGEO's CCS check in [21,](#_bookmark225) which you can emulate when examining their own CCS.

Second, measure all copyleft compliance from the position of the users[^5^](#_bookmark204) downstream from you exercising their rights under GPL. Have those users received notice of the copylefted software included in your product? Is CCS available to the users easily (preferably by automated means)? Ask yourself these questions frequently. If you cannot answer these questions with certainty in the positive, dig deeper and modify your process.

Avoid "compliance industry" marketing distractions and concentrate on the copylefted software you already know is in your product. Historically, the risk from a copylefted code snippet that some programmer dropped in your proprietary product careless of the consequences is a problem far more infrequent and less difficult to resolve. Efficient management of the risks of higher concern lies in making sure you can provide, for example, precisely CCS for a copy of Coreboot, the kernel named Linux, BusyBox, or GNU tar that you included in a product your company shipped two years ago than in the risk of 10 lines of GPL'd Java code an engineer accidentally pasted into the source of your ERP system.

Thus, reject the "compliance industry" suggestions that code scanners find and help solve fundamental compliance problems. Consider how COGEO's tend to use code scanners. FOSSology is indeed an important part of a violation investigation, but such is the last step and catches only some (usually minor) licensing notice problems. Thus, code scanners can help solve minor compliance problems once you have resolved the major ones. Code scanners do not manage risk.
