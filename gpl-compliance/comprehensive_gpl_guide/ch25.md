## 第25章 HAXIL，POLGARA和THESULAC：合并，上游供应商和无线电设备

This case study considers an ongoing (at the time of writing) violation that has occurred. By the end of the investigation period, three companies were involved and many complex issues arose.

本案例研究考虑了一起正在发生（在撰写本文时）的侵犯行为。调查期结束时，三家公司参与其中，出现了许多复杂的问题。

### 25.1 The Facts

### 25.1 事实

Haxil produced a consumer electronics device which included a mini GNU/Linux distribution to control the device. The device was of interest to many technically-minded consumers, who purchased the device and very quickly discovered that Free Software was included without source. Mailing lists throughout the Free Software community erupted with complaints about the problem, and FSF quickly investigated.

Haxil生产了一种消费电子设备，其中包括一个迷你GNU / Linux发行版来控制设备。该设备引起了许多技术爱好者的兴趣，他们购买了该设备，并很快发现其中包含未附源代码的自由软件。整个自由软件社区的邮件列表都在抱怨这个问题，FSF迅速展开调查。

FSF confirmed that FSF-copyrighted GPL'd software was included. In addition, the whole distribution included GPL'd works from hundreds of individual copyright holders, many of whom were, at this point, up in arms about the violation.

FSF确认包含了FSF版权的GPL软件。此外，整个发行版包括来自数百个个人版权持有者的GPL作品，其中许多人此时都对侵犯行为感到愤怒。

Meanwhile, Haxil was in the midst of being acquired by Polgara. Polgara was as surprised as everyone else to discover the product was based on GPL'd software; this fact had not been part of the disclosures made during acquisition. FSF contacted Haxil, Polgara, and the product managers who had transitioned into the "Haxil division" of the newly-merged Polgara company. Polgara's General Counsel's office worked with FSF on the matter.

同时，Haxil正在被Polgara收购。Polgara像其他人一样惊讶地发现该产品是基于GPL软件构建的；这个事实在收购过程中没有被披露。FSF联系了Haxil，Polgara和已经转入新合并的Polgara公司的“Haxil部门”的产品经理。Polgara的总法律顾问办公室与FSF一起处理此事。

FSF formed a coalition with the other primary copyright holders to pursue the enforcement effort on their behalf. FSF communicated directly with Polgara's representatives to begin working through the issues on behalf of itself and the Free Software community at large.

FSF与其他主要版权持有者组成了联盟，代表他们追求执行行动。FSF直接与Polgara的代表沟通，开始代表自己和整个自由软件社区处理问题。

Polgara pointed out that the software distribution they used was mostly contributed by an upstream provider, Thesulac, and Haxil's changes to that code base were minimal. Polgara negotiated with Thesulac to obtain the source, although the issue moved very slowly in the channels between Polgara and Thesulac.

Polgara指出，他们使用的软件发行版大部分是由上游供应商Thesulac提供的，并且Haxil对该代码库的更改很少。Polgara与Thesulac协商以获得源代码，尽管问题在Polgara和Thesulac之间的渠道中进展缓慢。

FSF encouraged a round-table meeting so that high bandwidth communication could occur between FSF, Polgara and Thesulac. Polgara and Thesulac agreed, and that discussion began. Thesulac provided nearly complete sources to Polgara, and Polgara made a full software release on their Web site. At the time of writing, that software still has some build problems (similar to those that occurred with Bortez, as described in Section [22.1).](#facts) FSF continues to negotiate with Polgara and Thesulac to resolve these problems, which have a clear path to a solution and are expected to resolve.

FSF鼓励进行圆桌会议，以便FSF，Polgara和Thesulac之间进行高带宽通信。Polgara和Thesulac同意，并开始讨论。Thesulac几乎完整地提供了源代码给Polgara，Polgara在其网站上发布了完整的软件版本。撰写本文时，该软件仍然存在一些构建问题（与第22.1节中描述的Bortez类似）。FSF继续与Polgara和Thesulac协商解决这些问题，这些问题有一个明确的解决路径，预计会解决。

Similar to the Vigorien case, Thesulac has regulatory concerns. In this case, it is not export controls - an issue that has since been resolved - but radio spectrum regulation. Since this consumer electronic device contains a software-programmable radio transmitter, regulations in (at least) the USA and Japan prohibit release of those portions of the code that operate the device. Since this is a low-level programming issue, the changes to operate the device form a single combined work with the kernel named Linux. A decade later, this situation remains largely unresolved.

与 Vigorien 案类似，Thesulac 也存在监管问题。在这种情况下，不是出口管制问题-该问题已经解决，而是无线电频谱监管问题。由于这种消费电子设备包含软件可编程无线电发射器，美国和日本的法规禁止发布操作该设备的代码部分。由于这是一个低级编程问题，操作设备的更改与名为 Linux 的内核形成一个单独的组合作品。十年后，这种情况仍然没有得到解决。

### 25.2 Lessons Learned

### 25.2 教训

1. **Community outrage, while justified, can often make negotiation more difficult.** FSF has a strong policy never to publicize names of GPL violators if they are negotiating in a friendly way and operating in good faith toward compliance. Most violations are honest mistakes, and FSF sees no reason to publicly admonish violators who genuinely want to come into compliance with the GPL and to work hard staying in compliance.

This case was so public in the Free Software community that both Haxil's and Polgara's representatives were nearly shell-shocked by the time FSF began negotiations. There was much work required to diffuse the situation. We empathize with our community and their outrage about GPL violations, but we also want to follow a path that leads expediently to compliance. In our experience, public outcry works best as a last resort, not the first.

2. **For software companies, GPL compliance belongs on a corporate acquisition checklist.** Polgara was truly amazed that Haxil had used GPL'd software in a major new product line but never informed Polgara during the acquisition process. While GPL compliance is not a particularly difficult matter, it is an additional obligation that comes along with the product line. When planning mergers and joint ventures, one should include lists of GPL'd components contained in the products discussed.

3. **Compliance problems of upstream providers do not excuse a violation for the downstream distributor.** To paraphrase 6, upstream providers are not responsible for enforcing compliance of their downstream, nor are downstream distributors responsible for compliance problems of upstream providers. However, engaging in distribution of GPL'd works out of compliance is still just that: a compliance problem. When FSF carries out enforcement, we are patient and sympathetic when the problem appears to be upstream. In fact, we urge the violator to point us to the upstream provider so we may talk to them directly. In this case, we were happy to begin negotiations with Thesulac. However, Polgara still has an obligation to bring their product into compliance, regardless of Thesulac's response.

4. **It behooves upstream providers to advise downstream distributors about compliance matters.** FSF has encouraged Thesulac to distribute a "good practices for GPL compliance" document with their product. Polgara added various software components to Thesulac's product, and it is conceivable that such additions can introduce compliance. In FSF's opinion, Thesulac is in no way legally responsible for such a violation introduced by their customer, but it behooves them from a marketing standpoint to educate their customers about using the product. We can argue whether or not it is your coffee vendor's fault if you burn yourself with their product, but (likely) no one on either side would dispute the prudence of placing a "caution: hot" label on the cup.

5. **FSF enforcement often avoids redundant enforcement cases from many parties.** Most Free Software systems have hundreds of copyright holders. Some have thousands. FSF is in a unique position as one of the largest single copyright holders on GPL'd software and as a respected umpire in the community, neutrally enforcing the rules of the GPL road. FSF works hard in the community to convince copyright holders that consolidating GPL claims through FSF is better for them, and more likely to yield positive compliance results.

<br/>

1. **社区的公愤，虽然有道理，但通常会使谈判变得更加困难。**自由软件基金会(FSF)有一个强有力的政策，即如果GPL违规者以友好的方式进行谈判并以诚信的态度遵守，FSF将永远不公开GPL违规者的名称。大多数违规都是诚实的错误，FSF认为没有理由公开责备那些真正想遵守GPL并努力保持合规的违规者。

这个案件在自由软件社区是如此公开，以至于 Haxil 和 Polgara 的代表在 FSF 开始谈判时几乎被打击了。需要做很多工作才能化解局势。我们理解我们的社区及其对GPL违规的愤怒，但我们也希望走一条通向合规的捷径。根据我们的经验，公众的抗议最好作为最后一招，而不是第一招。

2. **对于软件公司来说，GPL合规应该列在企业收购清单上。** Polgara 真的很惊讶 Haxil 在一个重要的新产品线中使用了GPL软件，但在收购过程中从未告知 Polgara。虽然GPL合规并不是一个特别困难的问题，但它是随着产品线而来的一个额外义务。在规划合并和合资企业时，应该列出所讨论产品中包含的GPL组件清单。

3. **上游提供商的合规问题并不能为下游分销商的违规行为开脱责任。**换句话说，上游提供商没有责任强制执行下游分销商的合规性，下游分销商也没有责任对上游提供商的合规问题负责。然而，未合规地分发 GPL 作品仍然是一个合规性问题。当 FSF 进行执法时，如果问题似乎出在上游，我们会耐心并且同情。事实上，我们敦促违规者指出上游供应商，以便我们可以直接与他们交流。在这种情况下，我们很高兴开始与 Thesulac 进行谈判。然而，Polgara 仍然有义务使他们的产品符合规定，而不管 Thesulac 的回应如何。

4. **上游提供商应该告知下游分销商合规事宜。**FSF 鼓励 Thesulac 在他们的产品中分发“GPL 合规的良好实践”文档。Polgara 将各种软件组件添加到 Thesulac 的产品中，这可能会引入合规性问题。在 FSF 的看法中，Thesulac 对于客户引入的违规行为没有任何法律责任，但从市场的角度来看，向他们的客户宣传产品的使用方式是值得的。我们可以争论是否应该归咎于您的咖啡供应商，如果您用他们的产品烫伤了自己，但（可能）双方都不会争议在杯子上贴上“注意：热”的标签的明智性。

5. **FSF 的执法通常避免了许多各方的重复执法案件。**大多数自由软件系统有数百个版权持有人。有些有数千个。作为 GPL 软件最大的单一版权持有人之一，以及社区中备受尊重的裁判员，FSF 处于独特的地位，中立地执行 GPL 路线规则。FSF 在社区中努力说服版权持有人通过 FSF 整合 GPL 索赔，这对他们更好，并且更有可能产生积极的合规结果。

A few copyright holders engage in the "proprietary relicensing" business, so they use GPL enforcement as a sales channel for that business. FSF, as a community-oriented, not-for-profit organization, seeks only to preserve the freedom of Free Software in its enforcement efforts. As it turns out, most of the community of copyright holders of Free Software want the same thing. Share and share alike is a simple rule to follow, and following that rule to FSF's satisfaction usually means you are following it to the satisfaction of the entire Free Software community.

几个版权持有者从事“专有重新许可”业务，因此他们将GPL执法用作该业务的销售渠道。作为一个面向社区的非营利组织，FSF仅在其执法工作中寻求保护自由软件的自由。事实证明，大多数自由软件版权持有者社区也希望实现同样的目标。共享并分享是一个简单的规则，遵循这个规则通常意味着你已经达到了整个自由软件社区的满意度。

Generally, from the experience of GPL enforcement, we glean the following general practices that can help in GPL compliance for organizations that distribute products based on GPL'd software:

通常从GPL执法的经验中，我们得出以下对于基于GPL软件的产品进行分发的组织来说可以帮助实现GPL合规的一些通用做法：

- Talk to your software engineers and ask them where they got the components they use in the products they build. Find out if GPL'd components are present.

- Teach your engineering staff to pay attention to license documents. Give them easy-to-follow policies to get approval for using a Free Software component.

- Build a "Free Software Licensing" committee that handles requests and questions about the GPL and other Free Software licenses.

- Add "What parts of your products are under the GPL or other Free Software licenses?" to your checklist of questions to ask when you consider mergers, acquisitions, or joint ventures.

- Encourage your engineers to participate collaboratively with GPL'd software development. The more knowledge about the Free Software world your organization has, the better equipped it is to deal with this rapidly changing field.

- When someone points out a potential GPL violation in one of your products, do not assume the product line is doomed. The GPL is not a virus; merely having GPL'd code in one part of a product does not necessarily mean that every related product must also be GPL'd. And, even if some software needs to be released that was not before, the product will surely survive. In FSF's enforcement efforts, we have not yet seen a product line die because source was released to customers in compliance with the GPL.

- 与你的软件工程师交谈并问问他们从哪里获得他们在构建产品中使用的组件。了解是否存在GPL组件。

- 教育你的工程人员注意许可文件。为他们提供易于遵循的政策，以获取使用自由软件组件的批准。

- 建立一个“自由软件许可”委员会，负责处理GPL和其他自由软件许可的请求和问题。

- 在考虑合并、收购或联合企业时，将“你的产品的哪些部分受GPL或其他自由软件许可证的保护？”添加到你的问题清单中。

- 鼓励你的工程师参与GPL软件开发的协作。你的组织对自由软件世界的了解越多，就越能应对这个快速变化的领域。

- 当有人指出你的产品可能存在GPL违规行为时，不要认为整个产品线都会毁掉。GPL不是病毒；仅仅在产品的某个部分存在GPL代码并不一定意味着每个相关产品都必须成为GPL。即使需要发布一些以前没有发布的软件，该产品也一定会生存。在FSF的执法工作中，我们还没有看到因为向客户发布了符合GPL的源代码而使得产品线死亡的情况。
