##　CHAPTER 12　INTEGRATING THE GPL INTO BUSINESS PRACTICES

## 第12章 将 GPL 整合到商业实践中

Since GPL'd software is now extremely prevalent through the industry, it is useful to have some basic knowledge about using GPL'd software in business and how to build business models around GPL'd software.

由于 GPL 授权的软件现在在行业中非常普遍，因此了解在商业中使用GPL授权的软件以及如何围绕GPL授权的软件构建商业模型是非常有用的。

## Using GPL'd Software In-House

## 在企业内部使用 GP L授权的软件

As discussed in Sections [3.1](#gplv2-0-freedom-to-run) and [7.2](#gplv2-5-acceptance-copyright-style) of this tutorial, the GPL only governs the activities of copying, modifying and distributing software programs that are not governed by the license. Thus, in FSF's view, simply installing the software on a machine and using it is not controlled or limited in any way by the GPL. Using Free Software in general requires substantially fewer agreements and less license compliance activity than any known proprietary software.

正如本教程第3.1节和7.2节中所讨论的，GPL仅控制未受许可证管辖的软件程序的复制、修改和分发活动。因此，根据FSF的观点，简单地在机器上安装软件并使用它并不受GPL的任何控制或限制。总的来说，使用自由软件所需的协议和许可证合规活动比任何已知的专有软件都要少得多。

Even if a company engages heavily in copying the software throughout the enterprise, such copying is not only permitted by GPLv2 1 and 3, but it is encouraged! If the company simply deploys unmodified (or even modified) Free Software throughout the organization for its employees to use, the obligations under the license are very minimal. Using Free Software has a substantially lower cost of ownership --- both in licensing fees and in licensing checking and handling -- than the proprietary software equivalents.

即使公司大量复制软件到企业中，这种复制不仅在GPLv2的第1条和第3条中是允许的，而且还被鼓励！如果公司只是部署未经修改（甚至经过修改的）自由软件供员工使用，则许可证下的义务非常少。使用自由软件的拥有成本（包括许可证费用以及许可证检查和处理方面）要比专有软件的等效物低得多。

## Business Models

## 商业模式

Using Free Software in house is certainly helpful, but a thriving market for Free Software-oriented business models also exists. There is the traditional model of selling copies of Free Software distributions. Many companies make substantial revenue from this model. Some choose this model because they have found that for higher-end hardware, the profit made from proprietary software licensing fees is negligible. The real profit is in the hardware, but it is essential that software be stable, reliable and dependable, and the users be allowed to have unfettered access to it. Free Software, and GPL'd software in particular, is the right choice. For instance IBM can be assured that proprietary versions of the their software will not exist to compete on their hardware.

在公司内部使用自由软件确实是有帮助的，但也存在一个以自由软件为导向的商业模式兴旺的市场。有传统的模式是销售自由软件发行版的副本。许多公司从这个模式中获得了大量的收入。一些公司选择这种模式，因为他们发现对于高端硬件来说，从专有软件许可费中获得的利润微不足道。真正的利润在于硬件，但是软件必须是稳定、可靠和可信赖的，并且用户可以自由获取它。自由软件，特别是GPL软件，是正确的选择。例如，IBM可以确信，他们的软件的专有版本不会存在以与他们的硬件竞争。

For example, charging a "convenience fee" for Free Software, when set at a reasonable price (around \$60 or so), can produce some profit. Even though Red Hat's system is fully downloadable on their Web site, people still go to local computer stores and buy copies of their box set, which is simply a printed version of the manual (available under a Free license as well) and the Free Software system it documents.

例如，对于自由软件收取“便利费”，如果价格合理（大约为60美元左右），可以产生一些利润。尽管Red Hat的系统可以在他们的网站上完全下载，但人们仍然会去当地的计算机商店购买他们的盒装套装，这只是手册的打印版本（同样可在自由许可下获得）和所记录的自由软件系统。

Custom support, service, and software improvement contracts are the most widely used models for GPL'd software. The GPL is central to their success, because it ensures that the code base remains common, and that large and small companies are on equal footing for access to the technology. Consider, for example, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). Cygnus Solutions, a company started in the early 1990s, was able to grow steadily simply by providing services for GCC --- mostly consisting of new ports of GCC to different or new, embedded targets. Eventually, Cygnus was so successful that it was purchased by Red Hat
where it remains a profitable division.

定制支持、服务和软件改进合同是GPL软件最广泛使用的模式。GPL对于它们的成功至关重要，因为它确保代码库保持共同，并且大大小小的公司在访问技术方面处于平等地位。例如，考虑GNU编译器集合（GCC）。上世纪90年代初创立的Cygnus Solutions公司，仅通过为GCC提供服务（主要包括将GCC移植到不同的或新的嵌入式目标）就能够稳步增长。最终，Cygnus取得了如此成功，以至于被Red Hat收购，现在它仍然是一个有利可图的部门。

However, there are very small companies that compete in this space. Modern industry demands the trust created by GPL protected code-bases. Companies can cooperate on the software and improve it for everyone. Meanwhile, companies who rely on GCC for their work are happy to pay for improvements, and for ports to new target platforms. Nearly all the changes fold back into the standard versions, and those forks that exist remain freely available.

然而，在这个领域中也有一些非常小的公司在竞争。现代产业需要由GPL保护的代码库所创造的信任。公司可以合作开发软件，并为每个人都进行改进。与此同时，那些依赖GCC进行工作的公司很乐意为改进和移植到新的目标平台付费。几乎所有的变化都会被折叠回标准版本中，而那些存在的分支仍然可以自由获取。

A final common business model that is perhaps the most controversial is proprietary relicensing of a GPL'd code base. This is only an option for software in which a particular entity holds exclusive rights to relicense.[^1^](#_bookmark168) As discussed earlier in this tutorial, a copyright holder is permitted under copyright law to license a software system under her copyright as many different ways as she likes to as many different parties as she wishes.

最后一个常见的商业模式可能是最具争议的，那就是专有软件重新许可一个GPL的代码库。这只是适用于那些拥有重新许可排他性权利的软件。如本教程前面所讨论的，根据版权法，版权持有人可以根据自己的意愿以任何不同的方式将软件系统许可给尽可能多的不同方。

Some companies use this to their financial advantage with regard to a GPL'd code base. The standard version is available from the company under the terms of the GPL. However, parties can purchase separate proprietary software licensing for a fee.

一些公司利用这一点在财务上获得了利益，与GPL许可的代码库相关。 标准版本可以在公司按照GPL条款的条件下获取。 但是，各方可以通过付费购买单独的专有软件许可证。

This business model is at best problematic and at worst predatory because it means that the GPL'd code base must be developed in a somewhat monolithic way, because volunteer Free Software developers may be reluctant to assign their copyrights to the company because it will not promise to always and forever license the software as Free Software. Indeed, the company will surely use such code contributions in proprietary versions licensed for fees.

这种商业模式充其量是有问题的，最坏的情况下是掠夺性的，因为它意味着GPL许可的代码库必须以某种集中的方式进行开发，因为志愿的自由软件开发人员可能不愿将其版权分配给公司，因为公司不会承诺永远将软件许可为自由软件。事实上，该公司肯定会将这样的代码贡献用于收费许可的专有版本中。

## Ongoing Compliance

## 持续合规

GPL compliance is in fact a very simple matter --- much simpler than typical proprietary software agreements and EULAs. Usually, the most difficult hurdle is changing from a proprietary software mindset to one that seeks to foster a community of sharing and mutual support. Certainly complying with the GPL from a users' perspective gives substantially fewer headaches than proprietary license compliance.

事实上，GPL合规实际上是一个非常简单的问题 —— 比典型的专有软件协议和最终用户许可协议(EULAs)简单得多。通常，最困难的障碍是从专有软件的心态转变为寻求培育共享和相互支持社区的心态。从用户的角度来看，遵守GPL比遵守专有许可证要简单得多，减少了很多麻烦。

For those who go into the business of distributing *modified* versions of GPL'd software, the burden is a bit higher, but not by much. The glib answer is that by releasing the whole product as Free Software, it is always easy to comply with the GPL. However, admittedly to the dismay of FSF, many modern and complex software systems are built using both proprietary and GPL'd components that are clearly and legally separate and independent works, merely aggregated together on the same device.

对于那些从事分发修改版GPL软件的业务的人来说，负担略微增加，但并不多。简单的答案是，通过将整个产品作为自由软件发布，始终很容易遵守GPL。然而，诚然让自由软件基金会(FSF)失望的是，许多现代复杂的软件系统是使用既有专有又有GPL组件构建的，这些组件在法律上明显独立并独立存在，仅仅是聚合在同一设备上。

However, it sometimes is easier, quicker, and cheaper to simply improve an existing GPL'd application than to start from scratch. In exchange for this amazing benefit, the license requires that the modifier gives back to the commons that made the work easier in the first place. It is a reasonable trade-off and a way to help build a better world while also making a profit.

然而，有时候，与其从头开始，改进现有的GPL软件可能会更容易、更快捷、更便宜。为了换取这一惊人的好处，许可证要求修改者将工作的成果回馈给共同体，因为共同体在第一时间让这项工作变得更容易。这是一个合理的权衡和一种帮助建设更美好世界同时也获得利润的方式。
