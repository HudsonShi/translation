## CHAPTER 16 WHEN THE LETTER COMES

## 第16章 当信来的时候

Unfortunately, many GPL violators ignore their obligations until they are contacted by a copyright holder or the lawyer of a copyright holder. You should certainly contact your own lawyer if you have received a letter alleging that you have infringed copyrights that were licensed to you under the GPL. This section outlines a typical enforcement case and provides some guidelines for response. These discussions are generalizations and do not all apply to every alleged violation. However, COGEO's in particular universally follow the processes described herein.

不幸的是，许多GPL违规者忽略了他们的义务，直到他们由版权所有者或版权律师联系持有者。如果你有，你当然应该联系你自己的律师收到一封信，声称您侵犯了版权已根据GPL授权给您。本节概述了一个典型的执法案例，并提供一些应对指南。这些讨论是概括性的，并不都适用于每一个所谓的违反。然而，COGEO特别普遍遵循此处描述的过程。

### 16.1 Communication Is Key

### 16.1 沟通是关键

GPL violations are typically only escalated when a company ignores the copyright holder's initial commu- nication or fails to work toward timely compliance. Accused violators should respond very promptly to the initial request. As the process continues, violators should follow up weekly with the copyright holders to make sure everyone agrees on targets and deadlines for resolving the situation.

GPL违规通常只会在公司忽略GPL时升级版权所有者的初步沟通或未能努力实现及时合规。被指控的违规者应非常迅速地回应最初的要求。随着过程的继续，违规者应遵循每周与版权所有者联系，以确保每个人都同意解决问题的目标和期限。

Ensure that any staff who might receive communications regarding alleged GPL violations understands how to channel the communication appropriately within your organization. Often, initial contact is addressed for general correspondence (e.g., by mail to corporate headquarters or by e-mail to general informational or support-related addresses). Train the staff that processes such communications to escalate them to someone with authority to take action. An uninformed response to such an inquiry (e.g., from a first-level technical support person) can cause negotiations to fail prematurely.

确保任何可能收到关于涉嫌违反GPL了解如何引导沟通适当地在您的组织内。通常，初次接触是用于一般通信（例如，通过邮寄给公司总部或通过电子邮件发送给一般信息或支持相关的地址）。培训处理此类通信的员工以将他们上报给有权采取行动的人。一个不知情的对此类询问的回应（例如，来自一级技术支持者）可能导致谈判过早失败。

Answer promptly by multiple means (paper letter, telephone call, and email), even if your response merely notifies the sender that you are investigating the situation and will respond by a certain date. Do not let the conversation lapse until the situation is fully resolved. Proactively follow up with synchronous communication means to be sure communications sent by non-reliable means (such as email) were received. Remember that the software freedom community generally values open communication and cooperation, and these values extend to GPL enforcement. You will generally find that software freedom developers and their lawyers are willing to have a reasonable dialogue and will work with you to resolve a violation once you open the channels of communication in a friendly way.

通过多种方式（纸质信函、电话、电子邮件），即使您的回复只是通知发件人您是调查情况，并将在特定日期前做出回应。不要让谈话停止，直到情况完全解决。以同步沟通方式主动跟进以确保通过不可靠的方式（例如电子邮件）发送的通信被已收到。请记住，软件自由社区通常重视开放的交流与合作，这些价值观延伸到GPL强制执行。您通常会发现软件自由开发商和他们的律师愿意进行合理的对话一旦您以友好的方式打开沟通渠道，我们将与您一起解决违规问题。

Furthermore, if the complaint comes from a COGEO, assume they are well-prepared. COGEO's fully investigate compliance issues before raising the issue. The claims and concerns will be substantiated, and immediate denials will likely lead the COGEO to suspect malice rather than honest mistake.

此外，如果投诉来自COGEO，假设他们是早有准备。COGEO之前全面调查合规问题提出问题。索赔和担忧将得到证实，并且立即否认可能会导致COGEO怀疑恶意而不是而不是诚实的错误。

However, the biggest and most perennial mistake that all COGEOs see during enforcement is this: failure to include the violators' software development teams in the enforcement discussions and negotiations. As described above, CCS verification and approval is the most time-consuming and difficult part of resolving most compliance matters. Without direct contact between software developers on both sides, the resolution of the technical issues involved in demonstrating that the binary distributed was built from the source provided is likely to be tortuous, expensive, and tense. Your lawyers will certainly be understandably reluctant to expose your employees to direct inquiry from potentially adverse parties. However, facilitated exchanges of information among software engineers communicating on technical subjects shortens the time to resolution, substantially reduces the cost of reaching resolution, and prevents unnecessary escalation due to mutual misunderstanding. Furthermore, such frank technical discussion will often be the only way to avoid compliance litigation once a violation has occurred.

然而，所有COGEO都看到的最大和最常犯的错误执法期间是这样的：未能包括违规者的软件执行讨论和谈判中的开发团队。作为综上所述，CCS验证认可是最解决大多数合规性的耗时且困难的部分事项。软件开发人员之间没有直接联系双方，解决涉及的技术问题证明二进制分发是从源代码构建的provided很可能是曲折的、昂贵的和紧张的。你的律师可以理解的是，您肯定不愿意让您的员工暴露在来自潜在不利方的直接询问。然而，促进软件工程师之间的信息交换技术主题大大缩短了解决问题的时间降低达成决议的成本，并防止不必要的因相互误会而升级。此外，这种坦率的技术讨论往往是避免合规的唯一途径一旦发生侵权行为。

Fortunately, these frank discussions will improve your company's relationships. Free Software develop- ment communities improve software to benefit everyone, which includes you and your company. When you use copylefted community software in your products, you are part of that community. Therefore, resolv- ing a compliance matter is an occasion to strengthen your relationship to the community, by increasing communication between your developers and the project whose work you use for business benefit.

幸运的是，这些坦率的讨论将提高贵公司的关系。自由软件开发社区得到改善使所有人受益的软件，包括您和您的公司。当您在您的产品中使用copylefted社区软件时，您那个社区的一部分。因此，解决合规问题是一个加强你与社区关系的机会，通过增加开发人员与项目之间的沟通您用于商业利益的工作。

### 16.2 Termination

### 16.2 终止

Many redistributors overlook the GPL's termination provision (GPLv2 4 and GPLv3 8). Under v2, violators forfeit their rights to redistribute and modify the GPL'd software until those rights are explicitly reinstated by the copyright holder. In contrast, v3 allows violators to rapidly resolve some violations without consequence.

许多再分发者忽略了GPL的终止条款（GPLv24和GPLv38)。在v2下，违规者将失去重新分配的权利并修改GPL软件，直到明确这些权利由版权所有者恢复。相反，v3允许违规者迅速解决一些违规行为而不承担任何后果。

If you have redistributed an application under GPLv2[^16-1^], but have violated the terms of GPLv2, you must request a reinstatement of rights from the copyright holders before making further distributions, or else cease distribution and modification of the software forever. Different copyright holders condition reinstatement upon different requirements, and these requirements can be (and often are) wholly independent of the GPL. The terms of your reinstatement will depend upon what you negotiate with the copyright holder of the GPL'd program.

如果您重新分发了一个应用程序GPLv2[^16-1^]，但是违反了GPLv2的条款，你必须要求版权所有者恢复权利在进行进一步分发之前，或者停止分发和永远修改软件。不同的版权所有者根据不同的要求条件恢复，这些要求可以（而且经常）完全独立于GPL。这您的恢复条款将取决于您与什么人谈判GPL程序的版权所有者。

Since your rights under GPLv2 terminate automatically upon your initial violation, *all your subsequent distributions* are violations and infringements of copyright. Therefore, even if you resolve a violation on your own, you must still seek a reinstatement of rights from the copyright holders whose licenses you violated, lest you remain liable for infringement for even compliant distributions made subsequent to the initial violation.

由于您在GPLv2下的权利在您的最初的违规行为，*您随后的所有分配*都是违规行为和侵犯版权。因此，即使您解决了一个自行侵权，仍须寻求恢复权利来自您违反其许可的版权所有者，以免您即使是合规分发，仍需承担侵权责任在最初的违规之后。

GPLv3 is more lenient. If you have distributed only v3-licensed programs, you may be eligible under v3 *§* 8 for automatic reinstatement of rights. You are eligible for automatic reinstatement when:

GPLv3更宽松。如果您只分发了v3许可程序，您可能有资格根据v3*§*8获得自动恢复权利。您有资格获得自动恢复什么时候：

you correct the violation and are not contacted by a copyright holder about the violation within sixty days after the correction, or you receive, from a copyright holder, your first-ever contact regarding a GPL violation, and you correct that violation within thirty days of receipt of copyright holder's notice.

您更正了违规行为并且版权所有者未与您联系在更正后六十天内通知违规行为，或您从版权所有者那里收到您的第一次联系关于违反GPL的行为，并且您在收到版权所有者的通知后三十天。

In addition to these permanent reinstatements provided under v3, violators who voluntarily correct their violation also receive provisional permission to continue distributing until they receive contact from the copyright holder. If sixty days pass without contact, that reinstatement becomes permanent. Nonetheless, you should be prepared to cease distribution during those initial sixty days should you receive a termination notice from the copyright holder.

除了v3下提供的这些永久恢复之外，自愿改正违规行为的违规者还会收到临时许可继续分发，直到他们收到来自版权所有者的联系方式。如果六十天过去了没有联系，该恢复成为永久性的。尽管如此，你应该准备在最初的六十天内停止分发应该您收到版权所有者的终止通知。

Given that much discussion of v3 has focused on its so-called more complicated requirements, it should be noted that v3 is, in this regard, more favorable to violators than v2.

鉴于对v3的大量讨论都集中在其所谓的更多复杂的要求，需要注意的是v3是，在这个考虑到，比v2对违规者更有利。

However, note that most Linux-based systems typically include some software licensed under GPLv2-only, and thus the copyright holders have withheld permission to redistribute under terms of GPLv3. In larger aggregate distributions which include GPLv2-only works (such as the kernel named Linux), redistributors must operate as if termination is immediate and permanent, since the technological remove of GPLv2-only works from the larger distribution requires much more engineering work than the negotiation required to seek restoration of rights for distribution under GPLv2-only after permanent termination.

但是，请注意大多数基于Linux的系统通常包括一些仅在GPLv2下许可的软件，以及版权所有者已拒绝根据GPLv3条款重新分发的许可。在更大的聚合发行版，其中包括GPLv2-only作品（例如名为Linux的内核），重新分配器必须像终止一样运行是直接和永久的，因为技术移除GPLv2-only适用于更大的发行版需要更多工程工作超过寻求恢复所需的谈判永久终止后仅在GPLv2下分发的权利。

[^16-1^]: This applies to all programs licensed to you under only GPLv2 ("GPLv2-only"). However, most so-called GPLv2 programs are actually distributed with permission to redistribute under GPLv2 *or any later version of the GPL* ("GPLv2-or-later"). In the latter cases, the redistributor can choose to redistribute under GPLv2, GPLv3, GPLv2-or-later or even GPLv3-or-later. Where the redistributor has chosen v2 explicitly, the v2 termination provision will always apply. If the redistributor has chosen v3, the v3 termination provision will always apply. If the redistributor has chosen GPLv2-or-later, then the redistributor may want to narrow to GPLv3-only upon violation, to take advantage of the termination provisions in v3.

[^16-1^]: 这适用于所有授权给您仅在GPLv2下（“GPLv2-only”）。然而，大多数所谓的GPLv2程序实际上是在允许重新分发的情况下分发的在GPLv2*或GPL*的任何更高版本（“GPLv2或更高版本”）下。在在后一种情况下，重新分配器可以选择重新分配GPLv2、GPLv3、GPLv2或更高版本甚至GPLv3或更高版本。在哪里再发行商明确选择了v2，即v2终止条款将永远适用。如果再分发者选择了v3，则v3终止条款将始终适用。如果再分配器有选择GPLv2或更高版本，则再分发者可能希望缩小范围GPLv3-only在违反时，利用终止v3中的规定。
