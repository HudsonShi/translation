CONCLUSION

本章小结

GPL compliance need not be an onerous process. Historically, struggles
have been the result of poor de- velopment methodologies and
communications, rather than any unexpected application of the GPL's
source code disclosure requirements.

遵循GPL并不一定需要特别复杂的流程。根据历史经验，糟糕的开发方法和沟通所导致的结果往往是争议，而非任何GPL源代码公开要求的不经意应用。

Compliance is straightforward when the entirety of your enterprise is
well-informed and well-coordinated. The receptionists should know how
to route a GPL source request or accusation of infringement. The
lawyers should know the basic provisions of Free Software licenses and
your source disclosure requirements, and should explain those details
to the software developers. The software developers should use a
version control system that allows them to associate versions of
source with distributed binaries, have a well-documented build process
that anyone skilled in the art can understand, and inform the lawyers
when they bring in new software. Managers should build systems and
procedures that keep everyone on target. With these practices in
place, any organization can comply with the GPL without serious
effort, and receive the substantial benefits of good citizenship in
the software freedom community, and lots of great code ready-made for
their products.

当您所在的企业可以得到充足的信息和良好的协作时，是很容易做到合规的。接洽人员应该熟悉如何发送GPL源请求或侵权指控。法务人员应该了解自由软件许可的基本条款和自有源代码的披露要求，并有义务向软件开发人员解释这些细节问题。软件开发人员应使用版本控制系统，通过该系统将源代码版本与分布式二进制文件相关联，使用一个良好的文档编辑流程，方便任何熟悉技术的人员快速理解，并可以在法务引入新软件时通知他们及时收悉。管理者应该建立一套能够让每个人都能达到目标的制度和程序。通过这些实践，任何组织都能轻而易举地遵守GPL，并在自由软件社区中获得良好公民身份的资格与福利，同时为他们的产品收获大量现成的优质代码。
