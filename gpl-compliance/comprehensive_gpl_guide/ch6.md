## CHAPTER 6 GPL'S IMPLIED PATENT GRANT

## 第6章 GPL的暗示专利授权

We digress again briefly from our section-by-section consideration of GPLv2 to consider the interaction between the terms of GPL and patent law. The GPLv2, despite being silent with respect to patents, actually confers on its licensees more rights to a licensor's patents than those licenses that purport to address the issue. This is the case because patent law, under the doctrine of implied license, gives to each distributee of a patented article a license from the distributor to practice any patent claims owned or held by the distributor that cover the distributed article. The implied license also extends to any patent claims owned or held by the distributor that cover "reasonably contemplated uses" of the patented article. To quote the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, the highest court for patent cases other than the Supreme Court:

我们再次暂时跳出对GPLv2的逐段审查，来考虑GPL条款和专利法之间的互动关系。尽管GPLv2在专利方面保持沉默，但它实际上向其许可证持有人授予了比那些声称处理此问题的许可证更多的许可证权利。这是因为根据暗示许可证原则，专利法规定，专利的分发者向每个分销专利物品的受让人授予许可证，该许可证覆盖分销的物品。暗示许可证也扩展到分销者拥有或持有的任何专利要求，该要求涵盖专利物品的“合理预期使用”。引用联邦巡回上诉法院（非最高法院）的话：

>Generally, when a seller sells a product without restriction, it in effect promises the purchaser that in exchange for the price paid, it will not interfere with the purchaser's full enjoyment of the product purchased. The buyer has an implied license under any patents of the seller that dominate the product or any uses of the product to which the parties might reasonably contemplate the product will be put.

>通常情况下，当卖家无限制地销售产品时，它实际上向购买者承诺，在支付的价格的交换条件下，不会干扰购买者对所购买产品的完全享用。买方在销售者拥有专利的任何专利下拥有隐含许可证，该专利主导产品或产品可能合理预期的任何用途。

Hewlett-Packard Co. v. Repeat-O-Type Stencil Mfg. Corp.， Inc.，123 F.3d 1445, 1451（Fed. Cir. 1997）。

Of course, Free Software is licensed, not sold, and there are indeed restrictions placed on the licensee, but those differences are not likely to prevent the application of the implied license doctrine to Free Software, because software licensed under the GPL grants the licensee the right to make, use, and sell the software, each of which are exclusive rights of a patent holder. Therefore, although the GPLv2 does not expressly grant the licensee the right to do those things under any patents the licensor may have that cover the software or its reasonably contemplated uses, by licensing the software under the GPLv2, the distributor impliedly licenses those patents to the GPLv2 licensee with respect to the GPLv2'd software.

当然，自由软件是许可，而不是销售，并且的确对许可证持有人施加了限制，但是这些差异不太可能阻止暗示许可证原则适用于自由软件，因为根据GPLv2许可的软件授予许可证持有人行使专利所有者的专属权利，即制作、使用和销售该软件。因此，尽管GPLv2没有明确授予许可证持有人使用其可能涵盖软件或其合理预期使用的任何专利的权利，但通过在GPLv2下许可软件，分销商对于GPLv2许可证持有人在GPLv2下许可有关GPLv2软件的这些专利授予了暗示许可证。

An interesting issue regarding this implied patent license of GPLv2'd software is what would be considered "uses of the \[software\] to which the parties might reasonably contemplate the product will be put." A clever advocate may argue that the implied license granted by GPLv2 is larger in scope than the express license in other Free Software licenses with express patent grants, in that the patent license clause of many of those other Free Software licenses are specifically limited to the patent claims covered by the code as licensed by the patentee.

关于 GPLv2 软件的这个暗示专利许可的一个有趣问题是，“当事方可能合理地预期产品将被用于的软件用途”。一个聪明的辩护人可能会主张，GPLv2 授予的暗示许可比其他明示专利授权的自由软件许可证的范围更广，因为许多其他自由软件许可证的专利许可条款特别限制了专利权人许可的代码所涵盖的专利权主张。

In contrast, a GPLv2 licensee, under the doctrine of implied patent license, is free to practice any patent claims held by the licensor that cover "reasonably contemplated uses" of the GPL'd code, which may very well include creation and distribution of modified works since the GPL's terms, under which the patented code is distributed, expressly permits such activity.

相比之下，GPLv2 授权人根据暗示专利许可原则可以自由实践授权人拥有的涵盖“合理预期用途”的专利权主张，这很可能包括创建和分发修改后的作品，因为 GPL 的条款明确允许这种活动，而该专利权主张覆盖了GPL的代码所涵盖的内容。

Further supporting this result is the Federal Circuit's pronouncement that the recipient of a patented article has, not only an implied license to make, use, and sell the article, but also an implied patent license to repair the article to enable it to function properly, Bottom Line Mgmt., Inc. v. Pan Man, Inc., 228 F.3d 1352 (Fed. Cir. 2000). Additionally, the Federal Circuit extended that rule to include any future recipients of the patented article, not just the direct recipient from the distributor. This theory comports well with the idea of Free Software, whereby software is distributed among many entities within the community for the purpose of constant evolution and improvement. In this way, the law of implied patent license used by the GPLv2 ensures that the community mutually benefits from the licensing of patents to any single community member.

联邦巡回法院在 Bottom Line Mgmt.，Inc. v. Pan Man，Inc.，228 F.3d 1352（Fed. Cir. 2000）中进一步支持了这一结果，该法院宣称，专利物品的接收者不仅具有制造、使用和销售该物品的暗示许可，而且还具有修理该物品以使其正常运行的暗示专利许可，而这也适用于专利物品的任何未来接收者，而不仅仅是从分销商直接接收的接收者。这个理论与自由软件的思想相符，即将软件分发给社区中的许多实体，以实现不断的演进和改进。通过GPLv2使用的暗示专利许可法，确保社区从专利许可中共同受益。

Note that simply because GPLv2'd software has an implied patent license does not mean that any patents held by a distributor of GPLv2'd code become worthless. To the contrary, the patents are still valid and enforceable against either:

需要注意的是，仅因为 GPLv2 的软件具有暗示专利许可，并不意味着任何分发 GPLv2 软件的公司持有的专利就变得毫无价值。相反，这些专利仍然有效，并且可以针对以下任一方强制执行：

 a. any software other than that licensed under the GPLv2 by the patent holder, and

 b. any party that does not comply with the GPLv2 with respect to the licensed software.

a. 除了由专利持有人授权的GPLv2软件之外的任何软件；

b. 与许可软件有关的任何方不遵守GPLv2许可证。

For example, if Company has a patent on advanced Web browsing, but also licenses a Web browsing program under the GPLv2, then it cannot assert the patent against any party based on that party's use of Company 's GPL'd Web browsing software program, or on that party's creation and use of modified versions of that GPL'd program. However, if a party uses that program without complying with the GPLv2, then Company can assert both copyright infringement claims against the non-GPLv2-compliant party and infringement of the patent, because the implied patent license only extends to use of the software in accordance with the GPLv2. Further, if Company distributes a competitive advanced Web browsing program that is not a modified version of Company 's GPL'd Web browsing software program, Company is free to assert its patent against any user or distributor of that product. It is irrelevant whether Company 's program is also distributed under the GPLv2, as Company can not grant implied licenses to Company 's patent.

例如，如果一家公司拥有先进的Web浏览专利，但也根据GPLv2许可证授权了一个Web浏览程序，那么它就不能基于该方使用公司的GPLv2 Web浏览软件程序或者使用该程序的修改版本来主张专利权。然而，如果一方未遵守GPLv2使用了该程序，那么公司可以主张针对该非GPLv2兼容方的版权侵权索赔和专利侵权，因为暗示的专利许可仅限于按照GPLv2使用软件。此外，如果公司发布一款不是公司的GPLv2 Web浏览软件程序的改进版竞争性先进Web浏览程序，那么公司可以自由地针对该产品的任何用户或分销商主张其专利权。无论公司的程序是否也在GPLv2下发布，都是无关紧要的，因为公司不能授予对公司的专利的暗示许可证。

This result also reassures companies that they need not fear losing their proprietary value in patents to competitors through the GPLv2 implied patent license, as only those competitors who adopt and comply with the GPLv2's terms can benefit from the implied patent license. To continue the example above, Company does not receive a free ride on Company 's patent, as Company has not licensed-in and then redistributed Company A's advanced Web browser under the GPLv2. If Company does do that, however, Company still has not lost competitive advantage against Company , as Company must then, when it re-distributes Company 's program, grant an implied license to any of its patents that cover the program. Further, if Company relicenses an improved version of Company A's program, it must do so under the GPLv2, meaning that any patents it holds that cover the improved version are impliedly licensed to any licensee. As such, the only way Company can benefit from Company 's implied patent license, is if it, itself, distributes Company 's software program and grants an implied patent license to any of its patents that cover that program.

这个结果还让公司放心，它们不必担心通过GPLv2暗示专利许可证将专利的专有价值损失给竞争对手，因为只有那些采用并遵守GPLv2条款的竞争对手才能从暗示的专利许可证中受益。继续以上述例子，公司不会因为未将公司A的先进Web浏览器授权并再分发GPLv2而获得免费乘车。然而，如果公司这样做了，公司仍然没有失去对公司的竞争优势，因为当它重新分发公司的程序时，必须授予任何涵盖该程序的专利的暗示许可证。此外，如果公司重新授权改进版的公司A程序，那么它必须按照GPLv2这样做，这意味着它持有的覆盖改进版的任何专利都会被暗示地许可给任何许可证持有者。因此，公司获得公司的暗示专利许可证的唯一途径是，如果它本身分发公司的软件程序并向任何涵盖该程序的专利授予暗示专利许可证。
