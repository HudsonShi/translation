# Building a FOSS Code Center

## "A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools."

DOUGLAS ADAMS

## Context

It is common for companies to have a "FOSS code center" or "open source download center" on their website, where users can download the (open source) source code for products.

While this delivery system is a great convenience to users, it should be noted that the GPLv2 license was drafted in a time when broadband connections were extremely rare, and therefore the focus of the license is mostly on delivering source code with the product or on a physical medium like a CD. In 2017, the situation has rapidly changed: Broadband is widely available (although it should be noted that there are still many places where broadband is rare, or even non-existent) and FOSS code centers fulfill all practical needs (namely, access to source code) for most people.

Although a FOSS code center could fulfill the requirements of the GPLv2 license in certain cases (like firmware updates, where providing source code on the same location could then fall under "equivalent access" from GPLv2, section 3), it should not be seen as a replacement for the traditional compliance methods, but instead as a convenience to users.

There are no strict rules when it comes to designing a FOSS code center, as every website is different. However, there are a few best practices which are mostly non-technical, that are worth following.

## "FOSS Code Center" as a Requirement

Many companies have a "FOSS code center" on their website. Some of the companies have added this as an afterthought, and not as a requirement for the design of the website. And whenever there is a new or updated website, the designers often are not []{#_bookmark28 .anchor}aware of the requirement for a FOSS code center, and it vanishes, with the company possibly falling out of compliance.

## Keep Firmware and Source Code Together

Sometimes FOSS code centers are not in the same place as firmware downloads. It might be useful to keep them together so it is clear which source code belongs to which firmware. It is recommended to at least make a reference to the right place in a (separate) FOSS code center from the firmware download page; otherwise users might not know where to find the corresponding source code and falsely assume that there is no source code, which would, of course, cause frustration.

# Tracking Tasks and Processes

## "Engineers like to solve problems. If there are no problems handily available, they will create their own problems."

SCOTT ADAMS

## Checklists

A quotation worth bearing in mind with regard to all aspects of compliance engineering comes from C. Northcote Parkinson:

*"Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion."*

When used properly, checklists can be a useful way to manage your GPL compliance tasks in a quick, consistent, and effective manner. When used incorrectly, they can be too general to cover the work at hand or become overwhelming catalog requiring endless review. A happy medium is the goal. What constitutes a happy medium really depends on your organizational size.

For a small organization, a general compliance checklist could be as simple as the following:

#### General Compliance Checklist

##### Step #1: Ongoing Compliance Tasks

Discover all FOSS early in the procurement/development cycle. Review and approve all FOSS packages used.

Verify the information necessary to satisfy FOSS obligations. Review and approve any outbound contributions to FOSS projects.

##### Step #2: Support Requirements

Ensure adequate compliance staffing and designate clear lines of responsibility.

Adapt existing business processes to support the FOSS compliance program.

Make training on the organization's FOSS policy available to everyone.

Track progress of all compliance activities.

This checklist is from the *OpenChain Curriculum slides*,10 which is based, in turn, on the Linux Foundation Open Compliance Program *Self-Assessment Compliance Checklist.*11

You might elect to have more specific checklists to address specific compliance goals. For example, the concept of addressing the "complete and corresponding" source code for distribution is arguably the first and most useful area for which to have a specific checklist. One way of approaching this would be to create an exhaustive list of all the steps possible and necessary. Another way would be to cover the "core" of the issue and leave details to trained personnel or sub- checklists as needed. What follows is an example of the latter.

#### Checklist For Rebuilding Product X

This checklist is part of the check-system for ensuring that "complete and corresponding" source code is available when distributing products containing GPL code.

##### Step #1

Is a complete description of the build environment provided?12

##### Step #2

Is a list of rebuild steps provided?

##### Step #3

Has a rebuild been successfully completed on a clean machine?

10. [**https://www.openchainproject.org/curriculum**](https://www.openchainproject.org/curriculum)

11. **[https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/opencompliance/self-](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/opencompliance/self-assessment-compliance-checklist)
    [assessment-compliance-checklist](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/opencompliance/self-assessment-compliance-checklist)**

12. This should include package versions and any similar information critical to ensuring compliance.

##### Step #4

Have the rebuild results been verified?

##### Step #5

Have any uncertainties been escalated to the Open Source support team?

Plenty of options exist for more comprehensive checklists. A great place to start is the Open Compliance Program Self-Assessment Compliance Checklist. This comprehensive list, which may be required for a larger organization, is, like the material above, free of charge and freely available, so you can explore what is best to meet your requirements.

## Flowcharts

One great way to approach the challenge of managing your GPL compliance process is to use flowcharts. Like checklists, flowcharts can be modest or complex. For various reasons, larger organizations tend towards weighty versions of both. You do not need to. C. Northcote Parkinson once again has a quote that is applicable in our context:

*"Expansion means complexity and complexity decay."*

Bearing this in mind, let us take the first steps towards introducing simple, clear flowcharts for GPL compliance.

Professionals in open source governance have been sharing suggestions for various flowcharts for years. For example, this photo shows Jeremiah Foster of the GENIVI Alliance adding thoughts to a distribution flowchart at an interactive session led by Armijn Hemel at the Open Compliance Summit 2015 in Japan.

In this section, we explore some example flowcharts that could support practical GPL compliance with minimum fuss and complexity.

To get the ball rolling, we will highlight an older flowchart loosely based on work by Arnoud Engelfriet from his tenure as the open source counsel at Royal Philips Electronics. He kindly shared his approach with Free Software Foundation Europe (FSFE) e.V., a charitable organization focused on promoting Free Software/Open Source, which then released a modified version to the world through inclusion in public presentations.

**Flowchart #0** is a great example of what we need to assist our work as compliance engineers. It is short, clear, and applicable to physically distributed devices. It pre-assumes relatively light and responsive infrastructure to support it:

1.  An "approved" list of open source licenses.

2.  A "rejected" list of open source licenses.

3.  A contact in the legal department to deal with any edge cases.

**Flowchart #0** was released into the public domain in January 2008 via FSFE's legal department --- at that time run by Shane Coughlan --- with the intention of helping to spread knowledge to companies of all sizes wondering how best to approach process management around open source.

After reviewing **Flowchart #0**, you will find a series of interconnected flowcharts prepared by Armijn Hemel to show a more detailed process for managing compliance matters. These are not intended to be a panacea for open source compliance flowcharting, but they do provide a substantial starting point that can be easily adopted, adapted, and deployed by organizations of all sizes.
