简介：导师计划旨在解决的问题

Why is it necessary to have open source and LF mentorship programs? 
为什么开源与LF导师计划是有必要的？

Open source communities face a two-fold problem: building diverse communities of developers and leadership succession. Mentorship programs help to solve the problem of ensuring robust succes-
sion and growth, where many new contributors become part of the community. Just as we require offspring as a human species to guar- antee the health and continuation of our legacy and culture long after the current generation is a living memory, new entrants enable open source to breathe new life and continuity into our communities. 
开源社区面临两个方面的问题：
建设多元化的开发者社区，以及领导力继承。导师计划有助于解决不断有新的贡献者参与的情况下，如何保障稳健的继承性以及社区成长的问题。就像我们需要作为人类物种的后代来保证我们的文化和遗产在当前这一代人成为鲜活记忆之后很长一段时间内可以持续影响和延续一样，社区的新晋成员能为我们的社区持续的注入新的活力和延续性。

We invest in our communities as beneficiaries of our open source legacy by giving new developers access to knowledge and expe- rience from more experienced participants. By helping new developers to begin, mentors can help ensure that the community continues to grow and thrive long after the founders of these projects cease their direct involvement. 
我们通过让新晋的开发者从更有经验的参与者那里的获取知识和经验，作为开源遗产的受益者再投资于我们的社区中。通过协助新的开发者，导师可以协助并保证社区在项目创始人停止直接参与后很长一段时间内可以持续发展壮大。

Investing in our future by providing access to generational knowledge is not the only reason mentorship programs exist. We also wish to foster underrepresented groups—whether women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, or non-native English speakers—to improve diversity within our communities. Shuah Khan, an open source fellow and Linux kernel maintainer, explains the grounding philosophy of the mentorship program, highlighting the importance of increasing diversity in open source communities, including the Linux kernel: 
“The end goal was to have a healthy and sustainable kernel community with diverse viewpoints. Diverse communities are healthy and thriving. Having a different viewpoint in the development process keeps them healthy and relevant and serves the needs of people globally. So, improving diversity and opening up the kernel community of people of different socioeconomic backgrounds was a huge component.”
通过代代相传的知识来投资我们的未来发展并不是导师计划存在的唯一原因。 我们还希望培养一些代表性不足的群体——无论是女性、LGBTQ+ 社区成员、残疾人还是非英语母语人士——以改善我们社区的多样性。 开源研究员和 Linux 内核维护者 Shuah Khan 解释了导师计划的基本理念，强调了增加开源社区多样性的重要性，包括 Linux 内核：
         “我们的最终目标是拥有一个有包容不同观点、健康且可持续的内核社区。 多元化的社区代表健康和繁荣。 在开发过程中拥有不同的观点可以使社区保持健康和活力，并满足所有人的需求。 因此，提高多样性和吸纳不同社会经济背景的人，是社区健康发展的一个重要组成部分。“

It’s no secret that the open source community and surrounding culture are historically male-dominated. The LF is actively trying to remedy this by involving and engaging members of underrepresented minority communities, including those less economically advantaged. 
众所周知，开源社区和周边文化历来由男性主导。 LF 正在积极尝试通过让代表性不足的群体社区的成员参与进来，包括那些经济条件较差的人，来改变这个现状。

Khan, who directs the LFX Mentorship program, states that addressing diversity within the open source community is a complex societal issue involving equitable access to resources and opportunities. 
LFX导师计划的Khan指出，解决开源社区多样性的问题是一个复杂的社会问题，它涉及了获得资源和机会的公平性。


She says, “It is an issue of people not having equitable access to resources. We have to do our part to make those resources available to people equitably so that they are easier to access, easier for people to self- learn, and thus more accessible for people to get involved in open source and break down barriers. These barriers are based on your background, the language you speak, and also your financial situa- tion and various other reasons.”*
她说，“这个问题涉及到人们无法公平的获取资源。我们必须要尽一份力量，让大家可以更容易的获得和学习，能公平的使用这些资源，打破障碍参与到开源社区中来。这些障碍通常是人们的背景、语言、财务状况和其他原因。”

Providing this kind of access means recognizing these barriers and tailoring services to respect the needs of diverse communities. This can take the form of offering paid mentorships in some instances and free mentorships in others. Khan explains,
提供对导师计划有差异的访问意味着确实存在这些障碍，并调整了对应的服务以尊重不同社区的需求。 比如通过在某些情况下提供付费指导和在其他情况下提供免费指导的形式。 Khan解释说，

“The goal here is to ask, how do we make it easier for people to overcome those barriers? Can we give these folks a little lift by providing resources like free training, free webinars, and paid mentorships? We have added unpaid mentorships because not everyone wants to or can get paid to access this program, as they know our program is a limited resource, and unpaid or credit-only helps us scale it without the funding constraints. So, we try to make it accessible to different needs, career transitions, etc. Our unpaid programs are well received, and we can increase the number of mentees per project.”
“这里，我们需要回答，如何让人们更容易克服这些障碍？ 能否通过提供免费培训、免费网络研讨会和付费指导等资源来帮助这些人？ 我们增加了无偿指导，因为导师计划是一种有限的资源，不是每个人都免费的，也不是每个人都希望通过导师计划赚钱，**无偿的帮助我们在没有资金限制的情况下扩展它**。 因此，我们试图让它满足不同的需求，比如职业转型等。我们的无偿项目很受欢迎，在每个项目中的也可以增加学员人数。”

It is clear that without bringing in these diverse groups of people, open source culture becomes stagnant, putting our projects at risk in terms of their ability to retain talent and inspire new developers to join them as maintainers or core contributors. 
很明显，如果不引入这些不同的人群，开源文化就会停滞不前，使我们的项目在留住人才和激励新开发者作为维护者或核心贡献者的吸引力方面面临风险。


Angela Brown, SVP and GM of events at the LF, explains the value of DEI initiatives from the perspective of acquiring talent. She says, 
LF 高级副总裁兼活动总经理 Angela Brown 从获取人才的角度解释了 DEI 计划的价值。 她说，

*“We have all these companies that desperately need open source talent, both now and in the coming years. How do we get people prepared for that? Diversity is a big aspect because that is where you’ll find a lot of this talent since these are previously overlooked groups.”*
“我们拥有所有这些迫切需要开源人才的公司，无论是现在还是未来几年。 我们如何让人们为此做好准备？ 多样性是一个很大的方面，这是会发现很多这种人才的地方，他们也是之前被忽略的群体 。”


Not only does a lack of diversity hurt the acquisition and retention of talent, but it also translates to attracting fewer developers and is detrimental to code maintenance prospects for those projects. One mentee from the Kubernetes project discussed how mentorship and other DEI programs could help introduce under- represented perspectives into code development to the advantage of the project. As they explained, 
缺乏多样性不仅会影响人才的获取和保留，导致更少的开发者的转化，最终不利于这些项目的代码维护。 Kubernetes 项目的一名学员讨论了导师计划和其他 DEI 计划如何帮助将少数派建议引入代码开发，从而使项目受益。 他们如此解释，

*“Greater representation from these groups introduces different people with different mindsets looking at a project, so when there’s a problem, we can have various approaches to it, which will help it get solved even faster.”*
“这些群体的代表性更强，可以让不同的人以不同的心态看待一个项目，所以当出现问题时，我们可以有不同的方法来解决它，这将有助于更快地解决问题。”
