## Mentorships and their impact on succession and diversity within open source
## 导师制及其对开源项目内的继承和多样性的影响

### Improving diversity
### 提高了多样性

Ensuring project health is not just about attracting new developers to replace the old; it's also about improving diversity in the open source community to make it more representative of the world. The code submitted to the projects themselves reflects this, where different perspectives worldwide contribute unique features that make the project relevant on a broader scale. Khan provides an example of this from the perspective of energy conservation. She says, 

确保项目健康不仅仅是吸引新的开发人员取代旧的开发人员；它还涉及改善开源社区的多样性，使其更具世界代表性。提交给项目本身的代码反映了这一点，世界各地的不同观点贡献了独特的特点，使项目在更大范围内具有相关性。Khan从节能的角度举了一个例子。 她说，

“We have kernel patches to improve power management on devices to help users from places like Africa and Southeast Asia, where they don't have as widespread access to charging infrastructure (for their laptops and mobile phones) as the rest of the world. They might not even have 24/7 electricity, which might be a luxury. California residents now realize they need backups with the wildfires they have been experiencing recently. So, these patches help conserve energy so that applications aren’t power hogs; this is critical to companies that sell products in these areas of the world. Different viewpoints come from diverse experiences, and open source software expresses their needs. We call this scratching our own itch, which results in unique features that benefit us all. That’s where diversity of thought comes into play.”

“我们用内核补丁来改善设备的电源管理，以帮助来自非洲和东南亚等地的用户，在这些地方，他们无法像世界的其他地区那样方便地访问充电的基础设施（用于给他们的笔记本电脑和手机充电）。他们甚至可能没有24小时/7天的全天候电力，这可能是一种奢侈。加州居民现在意识到，他们需要备份电力，以应对最近遭遇的野火。因此，这些补丁有助于节约能源，使应用程序不再那么耗电；这对于在世界上这些地区销售产品的公司来说至关重要。不同的观点来自不同的经历，开源软件表达了他们的需求。我们称此为“挠痒痒”，每个人都有自己的痒处，这会产生有益于我们所有人的独特功能。这就是思想多样性发挥作用的地方。”

Although the program is open to everyone by design, the LF has focused on getting more women and other underrepresented groups involved in LFX Mentorship programs.

尽管该计划在设计上向所有人开放，但LF一直专注于让更多的女性和其他代表性不足的群体参与LFX导师计划。

“We are trying to reach out to groups historically underrepresented within the open source community,” said Khan. “We did a big push, for example, to Black colleges and Hispanic colleges in the summer of 2021 to raise awareness, as a part-time program, to give them the flexibility to work from anywhere, and we are expanding that globally. We don’t require participants to be just students, either. When we say we are inclusive, we don’t say this will be just for women, LGBTQ+, or any particular denomination or group. We say this applies to anybody who wants to get involved with open source but does not know how to get started. So far, these are how our efforts have been, and we’ve seen more women participate. But it could be better. We have consistently improved our numbers since the program's inception in 2019. Our participation from women sits at 20% compared to 17% in 2019.”

Khan说：“我们正在试图接触那些在开源社区中历史上代表性不足的群体。” “例如，我们在2021年夏天大力推动黑人学院和西班牙裔学院提高认识，参加一项兼职计划，让他们能够灵活地在任何地方工作，我们正在向全球扩展这一点。我们也不要求参与者只是学生。当我们说我们具有包容性的时候，我们并不是说这将只针对女性、LGBTQ+或任何其他的特定教派或群体。我们认为，这适用于任何想加入开源但不知道如何开始的人。到目前为止，这就是我们所做的努力，而且我们看到更多的女性参与其中。但这可能会更好。自2019年该计划启动以来，我们的人数一直在不断提高。与2019年的17%相比，我们的女性参与率提高到了20%。

Kate Stewart, vice president of dependable systems at the LF, is passionate about bringing new talent and participants into open source projects. In fact, mentorship programs have been instrumental in recruiting new maintainers and advancing projects without direct funding, such as SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange). According to Stewart, “My involvement in mentorship programs began with the SPDX side from the Google Summer of Code. Way back when the project started, this was the only way we were able to make forward progress on some of our tools.”

LF可靠系统副总裁Kate Stewart热衷于将新的人才和参与者引入开源项目。事实上，在没有直接资金资助的情况下，导师计划有助于招募新的维护人员和推进项目发展，例如SPDX（软件包数据交换）。根据Stewart的说法，“从Google编程之夏开始，我参与SPDX项目的导师计划。早在项目开始时，这是我们能够在某些工具上取得进展的唯一途径。”

“One big reason it’s fulfilling is that this makes a difference in people’s lives. That little bit of encouragement, that little bit of lift, and having access to a mentor they can talk to and ask, is my patch good?”

“它令人满意的一个重要原因是，它改变了人们的生活。一点点的鼓励，一点点的提升，还有一个可以交谈的导师，可以询问我的补丁好吗？”

### A learning experience for mentees (and mentors)
### 学员（和导师）的一次学习经历

Mentorship programs can be helpful for both the mentee and the mentor. Mentees can benefit from having someone to look up to and learn from. As Khan notes, mentors can benefit from the satisfaction of helping others grow and develop and introduce them to new approaches to software development. She adds, 

导师计划对学员和导师都有帮助。有一个值得仰望和学习的导师，可以使学员受益。正如Khan所指出的，导师可以从帮助他人成长和发展的满足感中获益，也可以从学员那里了解软件开发的新方法。她补充说，

“Mentors could be locked into a way of doing things, as they have been in their role as maintainers for a very long time. So, when somebody new comes in and tries something new, you look at that new approach and go, oh! That makes sense; that’s another way to do things. So, the mentors themselves learn from mentoring. When I’m looking at patches for analysis sent from mentees who are fixing bugs, I am looking at different parts of the kernel that I am not familiar with in some cases. And sometimes, I need to go deep and understand what I am looking at before I can answer the questions from mentees in these areas, so it’s beneficial to me.”

“导师可能会形成了一种固定的做事方式，因为他们担任维护者的角色已经很长时间了。所以，当有新人进来尝试新事务时，你看到那种新方法有效，会很吃惊！这是有道理的; 是另一种做事的方式。所以，导师自己也会从指导中学习进步。当我查看分析学员提交的修复bug的补丁时，我同时也会查看到内核的不同部分，这些部分在某些情况下我并不熟悉。有时，对于学员提出的某些领域的问题，我需要深入分析才能回答，这对我来说也是受益的过程。”

The design of the kernel’s mentorship program helps new developers familiarize themselves with the kernel development process and provide them with guidance and support from more experienced developers. The program is also open to established developers who want to contribute to the kernel but need help with the process. Working with an experienced maintainer can inspire mentees to become maintainers themselves. As one mentee told us, 

内核导师计划的设计目的，是帮助新开发人员熟悉内核的开发过程，并为他们提供更有经验的开发人员的指导和支持。该计划也还面向那些想要为内核做出贡献，但需要帮助的成熟开发人员。与经验丰富的维护人员一起工作，可以激励学员成为维护人员。正如一位学员告诉我们的那样，

“Due to the mentorship program, I was able to understand the mindset of the maintainers … and I would happily take the responsibility of maintaining a project if anyone offers me the opportunity.” 

“由于导师计划，我能够理解维护人员的心态......如果有人给我机会，我很乐意承担维护项目的责任。”

Mentors can teach new developers about the culture and customs of the open source community, as well as the technical aspects of working on open source projects. They may offer guidance and support while also being a source of inspiration for innovative concepts. In addition, mentorship programs can help build relationships between people of different ages, experiences, and backgrounds. Khan explains, 

导师可以向新开发人员传授开源社区的文化和习俗，以及从事开源项目的技术方面的知识。他们可以提供指导和支持，同时也是创新概念的灵感来源。此外，导师计划可以帮助不同年龄、经历和背景的人之间建立关系。Khan解释说，

“One big reason it’s fulfilling is that this makes a difference in people’s lives. That little bit of encouragement, that little bit of lift, and having access to a mentor they can talk to and ask, is my patch good? Or is my communication good on this email list? Or even how we can help them respond to an upstream email conversation. As a mentor, I might ask that they pose specific questions upstream for effective communication. Or the mentee might say to me that the maintainer hasn’t responded to their patch. I can then say, as a mentor, give them more time to respond. Having someone who can watch over you and be an advocate is a big help when you are getting started in open source; it makes you more confident in understanding how the communication dynamic works.”

“它令人满意的一个重要原因是，它改变了人们的生活。一点点的鼓励，一点点的提升，还有一个可以交谈的导师，可以询问我的补丁好吗？或者我在这个电子邮件列表中的沟通是否良好？ 甚至我们可以帮助他们回复上游的邮件问话。作为导师，我可能会要求他们提出具体问题，以便进行有效的沟通。也许学员可能会告诉我，维护者还没有对他们的补丁做出回应。作为导师我可以说，给他们多一点的时间来回应。当一个人刚开始接触开源项目时，如果有人可以在一旁监督并给与指导是一个很大的帮助；这会让你更有信心去了解项目运作的动态方式。”

As Kate Stewart says, a maintainer requires a unique combination of technical skills and relationship management. 

正如Kate Stewart所说，项目的维护者需要兼具技术能力和关系管理能力。

“There is a recognition that the maintainership tasks are different than the coding tasks. Many people like to code, but this is a different set of skills. You have to understand the technical skills to be an effective maintainer, but you also have to have a lot more social intelligence. Code is easy. People are hard. Maintainership is about people management.”

“人们意识到，维护任务与编码任务不同。许多人喜欢编码，但维护任务需要一套不同的技能。你必须了解技术技能，才能成为一名有效的维护人员，但你还必须拥有更多的社交智慧。管理代码很简单。维护好人员很难。维护工作是关于人员管理的。”

Mentorship can also be a fulfilling experience for retired people who can pass on their expertise to the next generation of programmers to stay active in the technology industry. Stewart discusses the individuals she recruits in former executive roles at major corporations to act as mentors: 

对于退休人员来说，导师计划也是一种充实的体验，他们可以将自己的专业知识传授给下一代的程序员，让他们在科技行业保持活跃。Stewart讨论了她在大公司的前高管职位中招募的担任导师的人员：

“Many experienced people are retiring—so how do we keep them engaged? These folks have a lot of skills, so how do they pass them on, and how can it become something they enjoy doing? A friend of mine is a couple of years older than me, and he retired from NXP. He’s sitting around at home, puttering around. And I am saying to myself, how can I lure him into working on some open source projects? It’s rewarding and effective for people who have had a full career, don’t want to do a full-time job, but still want to keep their hand in things and be effective.”

“许多有经验的人都要退休了，我们如何让他们参与进来呢？这些人有很多技能，如何传承，如何让他们继续做喜欢的事情？我的一个朋友比我大几岁，他从NXP退休了。他闲坐在家里，到处闲逛。我在想，怎样才能吸引他从事一些开源项目呢？这些人已经有了完整的职业生涯，不想做全职工作，但仍然希望自己动手做事并保持高效，加入开源项目是有益的，也是有效的。”

### Confidence building
### 构建信心

While any community needs some form of guidance and support for its members, this is especially true in the open source world. The development of open source software presents unique challenges. Volunteers often develop it, and they may not have professional experience. This also influences their desire to engage in open source in the first place, as expressed by 100 LFX Mentorship mentees surveyed in 2022. FIGURE 3 shows almost two-thirds of mentees lacked some confidence in their ability to engage in open source before they joined the program.

任何社区都需要为其成员提供某种形式的指导和支持，在开源世界中尤其如此。开源软件的开发带来了独特的挑战。志愿者经常编程，但他们可能没有专业的开源项目经验。这也影响了他们参与开源项目的愿望，正如2022年接受调查的曾经参与LFX导师计划的100名学员所表达的那样。图3显示，近三分之二的学员在加入LFX之前对他们参与开源项目的能力缺乏信心。

One of the positive outcomes of surveying mentees was the reported increase in confidence that mentorship programs create. FIGURE 4 shows that 90% of mentees report increased confidence compared to their level before starting the program. 

据报告，对学员进行调查的一个积极结果是，导师计划使他们的信心有所增加。图4显示，90%的学员表示，与开始该计划之前的水平相比，他们的信心提高了。

Qualitative interviews confirmed these results. One mentee interviewed from the Linux kernel project said they decided to join the program to level up their technical skills but also gained confidence in communicating with the community for help and advice. They explained, 

定性访谈证实了这些结果。采访了一位来自Linux内核项目学员表示，他们决定加入导师计划是为了提升自己的技术技能，但同时也获得了与社区沟通以寻求帮助和建议的信心。他们解释说，

“I found that the kernel community was extremely patient with me… as I dealt with the fact that I need to accept help, suggestions, and advice.”

“我发现内核社区对我非常耐心......我接受了我需要帮助、给与建议和给与忠告的事实。”

Another mentee from CNCF shared a similar reflection on their increased confidence because of the program: 

另一位来自CNCF的学员，分享了他们因该导师计划而增强信心的类似经验：

“I believe my ability to explain myself or to present myself has increased … now, whenever I face a problem, I just publicly go on Slack, and I just say I’m facing issues.”

“我确信，在解释或展示自己的作品方面，我的能力有所提高......现在，每当我遇到问题时，我都会去上Slack，说明我遇到了什么问题。”

Mentorship can provide these individuals with the skills and knowledge to succeed. Khan elaborates, 

导师制可以为这些人提供成功所需的技能和知识。Khan详细说明，

“Mentees are getting direct access to experts in those projects and benefiting from the experience of maintainers. They get a one-on-one meeting with the maintainers and experts. They can bounce ideas off of mentors before submitting their upstream contributions. That’s a huge confidence-building factor.

“学员们可以直接接触这些项目的专家，并从维护人员的经验中受益。他们与这些维护人员和专家进行一对一的会谈。在提交代码贡献之前，他们可以征求导师的意见。这是一个巨大的建立信心的因素。

So, for example, with the 13 mentees I mentored this last summer, some of the questions they asked me were interesting, such as, was our community open? If we send patches, will you review them? And they ask other development questions, such as the length of the development processes of particular vendors, the ideal time to send patches, how long it takes for a maintainer to review the patches, etc. All of these are questions that come up in one-on-one conversations. They have to sort through a lot of information as part of being a contributor to an open source project, and sifting through that is hard for them. So, when they have one-on-one relationships with mentors, it helps.”

例如，去年夏天我指导了13名学员，他们问我的一些问题很有趣，例如，我们的社区是否开放？ 如果我们发送补丁，你会审查它们吗？他们还问了一些其他的开发问题，例如特定需求的开发过程的有多长、提交补丁的理想时间、维护人员审查补丁需要多长时间等。所有这些问题都是在一对一的对话中出现的。作为一个开源项目的贡献者，他们必须整理大量的信息，而筛选这些信息对他们来说很困难。因此，当他们与导师建立一对一的关系之后，导师会提供很多指导。”

### Community building through mentorship

Mentorship can also help to foster a sense of community within the open source world. By providing guidance and support, mentors can help to create an environment where people feel welcome and
valued. This, in turn, can encourage more people to participate in open source projects, which can only serve to improve the quality of the software produced. As one mentee told us, “Apart from the technical skills I picked up from my mentorship
project, I also learned the art of communicating technical ideas with like-minded people … I could convey my ideas properly, and even though I was just expecting clarifications on what I should not
implement, I received a lot of support from the community to kickstart my first open source project.” 

When thinking about how mentorship programs benefit open source, it’s important to consider other intangibles in addition to bringing in new developer blood and how they address diversity
issues. Khan states it’s not simply a balance sheet: “Bringing in new developers and training them is obvious, right? When new developers come in, they bring in a new point of view,
injecting relevant new ideas like when companies hire new people. 

Similarly, teaching open source philosophy and the importance of open source early on, in the early part of their careers, will be beneficial to them. It’s also beneficial to have more trained open source
developers—they come in and already understand the ecosystem, and part of our training helps them understand that ecosystem. All of that is beneficial—it all comes back to the question of the
benefits of open source in the first place. So, it’s hard to prove the bottom line. Training and mentoring new developers are part of that bottom line—all this time and money I spend is not a balance
sheet. It’s an intangible benefit that you cannot prove. Yes, it’s beneficial, but you cannot put a dollar amount on it.”

By completing the mentorship program, mentees are subject to the inner workings of creating and maintaining open source projects. This exposure inspires them to continue contributing to
projects. As one mentee said, “I have been actively contributing to open-source ever since.” Another mentee shared how their experience supporting a new project during the program made them
confident in starting their own projects: “After graduating from the program, I went on to start my own open source projects in the JuliaLang community. I had seen the
ins and outs of project ideation to the completion of an industry- grade software feature. I was confident enough that I could start working on my own project to attract open source contributions
someday.”

The LFX Mentorship program can claim a high success rate as to the disposition of mentees toward open source contribution post-graduation. Eighty-five percent of mentees are or are willing
to continue contributing to the project they were involved in after mentorship, as illustrated in FIGURE 5.

“ After graduating from the program, I went on to start my own open source projects in the JuliaLang community. ... I was confident enough that I could start working on my
own project to attract open source contributions someday.”
