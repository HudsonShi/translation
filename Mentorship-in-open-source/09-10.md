The history of mentorships in open source and the technology industry 
开源和技术领域的导师制历史

Open source mentorships date back to 2005 with the introduction of Google’s Summer of Code, a program the company has run for the last 17 years. It targets college students and provides a stipend (of $1,500 to $6,600, depending on size and location) to work on an open source project. The program has expanded to include high school, postsecondary, and graduate students. Similarly, Google’s Code-In, targeted at 13 to 17-year-olds, ran from 2010 to 2019. 
Beyond Google, other companies are releasing technology industry mentorship programs, such as Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Meta, and Red Hat. As with Summer of Code, these programs are typically 12 weeks long and take place during the summer. They are open to students at least 18 years of age who have completed one year of college. 
开源导师制可以追溯到 2005 年，当时谷歌推出了 “谷歌的代码之夏”，该公司在过去 17 年中一直在运行该计划。 它面向大学生并提供津贴（根据规模和地点，提供1,500 美元到 6,600 美元）以从事开源项目。 该计划已扩大到包括高中生、大专生和研究生。 同样，谷歌的 “谷歌Code-In” 项目针对 13 至 17 岁的人群，从 2010 年持续到 2019 年。
除了谷歌，其他公司也在发布技术行业指导计划，例如微软、IBM、亚马逊、Meta 和红帽。 与”谷歌代码之夏”一样，这些项目通常为期 12 周，并在夏季向年满 18 岁且已完成一年大学学业的学生开放。

# The genesis of mentorship at the LF 
LF 导师制的起源

The idea of mentorship at the LF initially came about to bring maintainers into the fold for its Linux kernel project. As with many open source projects, the kernel’s developer population has  grown organically—it is not a traditional hire and talent placement scenario. The need to replace developers over time is crucial to the stability and longevity of the project, and mentorship is one way to achieve this. The organization decided to become more intentional about how it could help new developers get up to speed and become productive members of the open source community. 
LF 的指导思想最初是为了拉动开发者参与其 Linux 内核项目的维护。 与许多开源项目一样，内核的开发人员数量已经实现了自然增长——不依赖传统的招聘方式。 随着时间的推移，开发者更迭对于项目的稳定性和成长性至关重要，而导师制度是实现这一目标的一种方式。 因此，组织决定更加专注于如何帮助新开发者加快成为开源社区高效产出的成员。

The pilot mentorship program launched within the kernel community in 2019 had a few simple objectives: to help new developers feel welcome, learn the ropes, and accept their first code contributions. Khan identified these objectives and the goal of increasing diversity. She says, 
*“We identified three reasons for starting the program: diversity, community health, and sustainability. You have to inject new talent and bring in people, new developers that can take over at some point from the aging maintainer population and step into these important roles. So, we felt that the best approach at the time would be having these developers trained by maintainer experts in those areas.”*
2019 年在内核社区内启动的试点导师计划有几个简单的目标：让新的开发者有归属感、摸到门道并接受他们的第一个代码贡献。 Khan说，
*“我们确定了启动该计划的三个原因：多样性、社区健康和可持续性。 必须注入新的人才并引入新的开发人员，他们可以在某个时候接替退休的维护人员并担任这些重要角色。 因此，我们认为最好的方法是让这些开发人员接受这些维护专家的培训。”*

Khan looked at previous examples of mentorship programs at other open source organizations and wanted to broaden mentorships outside of their student-centric focus by inviting industry professionals into the program. This also required unique accommodations that similar programs only previously had. Khan adds, 
*“I talked to people running mentorship programs at the time, such as Outreachy and Google Summer of Code, and how they viewed the shortcomings of those programs. One part that came up as a big thing was that it would be helpful to have it as a part- time program; thus, we added that early on. We also decided not to restrict it to students because career transition is very important. And I chose to run three sessions, spring, summer, and fall, like a college or university, so that it would be accessible to people globally.*
Khan 查看了其他开源组织以前的导师计划案例，并希望通过邀请产业界的专业人士加入该计划来扩大之前以学生为重点的指导。 这也是需要单独进行协调，之前并无先例。 Khan补充道，
*“我与当时运行导师计划的人进行了交谈，例如 Outreachy 和 Google Summer of Code的相应人员，以及他们如何看待这些计划的缺点。 把该计划作为一个兼职项目是个很好的事情； 因此，我们很早就添加了这一点。 我们还决定不将其仅限于学生，因为职业转型非常重要。 我选择举办春季、夏季和秋季三个课程，就像学院或大学一样，以便所有的人都可以使用它。*


*So, for example, the spring session is probably the one that people from the southern hemisphere could participate in because it is their summer. The summer session would be for other people and students. For others, they could fit into a three-month or six-month program.”*

*例如，春季班可能是南半球的人可以参加，因为那是他们的夏天。 暑期班是为其他人和学生准备的。 对于其他人，他们可以参加为期三个月或六个月的课程。”*

Another approach to attract industry professionals was opening the program to anyone, regardless of employment status. As Khan explains, 
*“We don’t require applicants to be unemployed; they can be fully employed, part-time, or of any kind of status. We simply say if you can spend 20 to 40 hours a week learning and advancing your skills, you’re welcome to apply to our program.”*
Khan also explains why they chose not to restrict participants based on demographics: 
*“Other programs restrict their mentorships to students only or women and LGBTQ+. Some of these are 100% diverse in their population, which is excellent. However, they are fishing from a smaller pond to begin with, which purposefully restricts the size of their addressable communities and programs. We didn’t want to do that; we’re open to everyone.”*
The program, now known officially as LFX Mentorships, has since been expanded beyond the Linux kernel to include other open source projects under the LF umbrella, such as Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Hyperledger, Open Mainframe Project, ELISA, Zephyr, RISC-V, and Automotive Grade Linux.

另一种吸引产业界专业人士的方法是向任何人开放该计划，无论其就业状况如何。 Khan解释：
“我们不要求申请人脱产； 他们可以是全职、兼职或任何身份。 我们只是说，如果你每周能花 20 到 40 个小时学习和提高你的技能，欢迎你申请我们的项目。”
Khan 还解释了为什么他们选择不根据人口统计的数据来限制参与者：
“其他项目将他们的指导仅限于学生或女性和 LGBTQ+。 其中一些在其人口中 100% 多样化，这非常好。 然而，他们面向比较垂直的人群，这刻意的限制了对应的社区和项目的规模。 我们不想那样做； 我们向所有人开放。”

该计划现在正式称为 LFX Mentorships，此后已扩展到 Linux 内核之外，包括 LF 旗下的其他开源项目，例如云原生基金会 (CNCF)、Hyperledger、Open Mainframe Project、ELISA、Zephyr、RISC -V 和AGL等社区和项目。
