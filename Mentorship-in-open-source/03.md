## Mentorship program challenges

## 导师计划的挑战

"Financial incentives are not effective motivators for open source developers in general."

"一般来说, 对于开源开发人员，经济激励并不是有效的激励因素。"

While mentorship programs can help bring underrepresented groups into the field of software engineering and help refresh the maintainer population, there is still room for improvement.

虽然导师计划可以帮助将未被充分代表的群体带入软件工程领域并帮助更新维护人员群体，但仍有改进的余地。

While the LFX Mentorship program has thousands of applicants every year, the selection process weeds out many people who cannot commit to the program. For one, the programs can be time-consuming and require considerable commitment from participants. In many ways, LFX Mentorship participation as a mentee and mentor follows the self-selection model of open source participation. Even more problematic is the need to get more mentors involved; a lack of mentors can lead to frustration and discouragement for the mentees.

虽然LFX导师计划每年都有成千上万的申请者，但选拔过程淘汰了许多无法参与该计划的人。一方面，这些计划可能很耗时，并且需要参与者做出相当大的承诺。在许多方面，LFX导师参与计划包含受训者和导师，他们需要遵循参与开源的自我选择模式。更大的问题是需要让更多的导师参与进来；缺乏指导者会导致受指导者感到挫败和沮丧。

To encourage more mentors to join these programs, Kate Stewart would like to see more recognition and incentives for the mentors themselves.

为了鼓励更多的导师加入这些项目，Kate Stewart希望看到对导师本身的更多认可和激励。

"One of our biggest challenges for mentorship is, how do we get to scale? The scientific work has illustrated that people don’t stick around once they are there—some do, and some don’t. So, we have maintainer burnout. So, the question is, how do you get the people who have been mentored to do the next generation of mentoring so we can scale up instead of everything falling on the maintainers?

我们在指导方面面临的最大挑战之一是，我们如何扩大规模？科学研究表明，人们一旦到了某地就不会停下来——有些人会，有些人不会。所以，我们有维护者倦怠。所以，问题是，你如何让接受过指导的人进行下一代指导，这样我们就可以扩大规模，而不是一切都落在维护者身上？

Motivating graduates to co-mentor is proving to be successful. Some graduates view the opportunity to co-mentor with an experienced mentor as an opportunity to learn and something they can show as an achievement. Financial incentives are not effective motivators for open source developers in general."

事实证明，激励毕业生担任共同导师是成功的。一些毕业生认为与经验丰富的导师共同指导的机会是他们学习的机会，他们也能过展示自己成就。一般来说, 对于开源开发人员，经济激励并不是有效的激励因素。

Mentorship programs can help bring underrepresented groups into the field of software engineering, but they face significant challenges in attracting diverse participants and ensuring they have a rewarding experience once involved. Adequate training and support for mentors and mentees can help address these challenges. Additional resources can make it easier for everyone involved to get the most out of the experience. In addition, by connecting individuals from different backgrounds and experiences, mentorship programs can help create a more diverse and inclusive community within software engineering.

导师计划可以帮助将未被充分代表的群体带入软件工程领域，但他们在吸引不同的参与者并确保他们一旦参与后获得有益的经验方面面临重大挑战。对导师和受训者的充分培训和支持可以帮助应对这些挑战。额外的资源可以让所有相关人员更轻松地充分利用他们的经验。此外，通过将来自不同背景和经验的个人联系起来，导师计划可以帮助在软件工程中创建一个更加多样化和包容的社区。

Some of this support can come in the form of funding. Angela Brown, SVP and GM of events at the LF, discussed the value of funding an individual’s participation in a program or event. She offers travel funding to early career professionals to attend open source events within her portfolio. When reviewing the demo graphics of those who have previously received funding, she notes,

其中一些支持可以以资金的形式提供。 LF的高级副总裁兼活动总经理Angela Brown讨论了资助个人参与计划或活动的价值。她为早期职业专业人士提供旅行资金，以参加她投资组合中的开源活动。在查看那些先前获得资助的人的演示图形时，她指出，

"Most of our funding goes to diversity. Many recipients of event travel funding are women from all over the world, so it gives us a more diverse set of people participating in our events compared with what we see in the mentorship program."

我们的大部分资金用于多元化。许多活动旅行资助的接受者都是来自世界各地的女性，因此与我们在导师计划中看到的相比，它让我们参与活动的人更加多样化。

Diversity funding is one way to encourage greater representation in the network of early-career open source developers and expose them to more career opportunities within and outside of the mentorship program.

多元化资助是鼓励早期职业开源开发人员在网络中有更多代表性并让他们在指导计划内外获得更多职业机会的一种方式。

But while training and other resources within mentorship programs can help improve the programs themselves, there are also fundamental problems attracting individuals into mentorship programs due to the limited supply of interdisciplinary software developers trained in embedded systems and software engineering regardless of gender, identity, or socioeconomic background.

但是，尽管导师计划中的培训和其他资源可以帮助改进计划本身，但由于受过嵌入式系统和软件工程培训的跨学科软件开发人员供应有限，无论性别、身份或社会经济背景状况如何，吸引个人参与指导计划也存在根本性问题。

This makes it challenging to find qualified individuals willing to participate as mentors and mentees. In addition, many potential mentees may be reluctant to join a program because they do not have the necessary skills or experience.

这使得很难找到愿意作为导师和参与受训的合格人员。此外，许多潜在的学员可能不愿意加入某个项目，因为他们不具备必要的技能或经验。

The problem is not necessarily a lack of technology professionals. A rebound in the percentage of computer science and information degrees conferred by U.S. universities followed a period of decline, accounting for almost 5% of all degrees in 2020, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.[1] According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the expectation is that employment for all computer and math-related jobs will grow 15% over the next decade.[2]

问题不一定是缺乏技术专业人员。根据美国国家教育统计中心的数据，美国大学授予的计算机科学和信息学位比例在经历了一段时间的下降后出现反弹，2020年占所有学位的近5%。[1] 根据美国劳工统计局的数据，预计所有计算机和数学相关工作的就业人数在未来十年内将增长 15%。[2]

Instead, it is a question of a skill sets gap. Many of these prospective open source developers do not live in geographies where the required skills are taught in educational institutions.

相反，这是一个技能差距的问题。许多这些潜在的开源开发人员并不居住在教育机构教授所需技能的地区。

These limiting factors have led to a disproportionate underrepresentation of mentees from those parts of the world. Seventy-six percent of respondents to the survey indicated that they lived in the Asia-Pacific region, whereas 14% said they lived in EMEA. Only 10% said they lived in the Americas. (See the Demographics section.)

这些限制因素导致来自世界这些地区的受训者比例过低。76%的调查受访者表示他们住在亚太地区，而14%的人表示他们住在EMEA。只有10%的人说他们住在美洲。（请参阅人口统计部分。）
