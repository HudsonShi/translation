## Career benefits of mentorship programs 
## 导师计划的职业福利

In addition to improving community health by fostering diversity 
and cultivating a new generation of open source developers within 
these projects, mentorship programs can have a transformative 
economic impact on mentees' lives after they graduate.

通过这些项目可以促进多样性和培养新一代开源开发者以改善社区健康，除此之外，导师计划还可以对学员毕业后的生活产生变革性的经济影响。

Receiving compensation and being able to cover living expenses 
is a key concern for mentees when contributing to open source 
projects. **FIGURE 6** shows that two-thirds of LFX Mentorship 
mentees had no prior experience getting paid for their open 
source involvement before beginning the mentorship.

在为开源项目做出贡献时，获得报酬以能够支付生活费用是学员关注的一个关键问题。**图6**显示，在参加LFX导师计划的学员中，有三分之二的人表示，在这个项目之前没有因参与开源项目而获得报酬的经验。

The lack of compensation is partially due to many mentorship 
program applicants still needing to fully enter the professional 
world. Per **FIGURE 7**, before joining the mentorship program, 85% 
were students; after completing the program, 63% of former 
mentees had at least a part-time job. 

缺乏补偿的部分原因是，许多参加导师计划的申请人要求完全进入专业领域。根据**图7**，在加入导师计划之前，85%是学生；完成该项目后，63%的前学员至少有一份兼职工作。

Regarding overall compensation before and after graduation, 67% of 
those employed and willing to discuss the subject saw their incomes 
increase after graduation from the mentorship program. (**FIGURE 8**).

关于毕业前和毕业后的总体薪酬，67%的就业者和愿意讨论该主题的人表示，在导师计划项目毕业后收入有所增加（**图8**）。

Mentorship programs can also create new and increased career 
opportunities for mentees. Participating in a mentorship program 
can give mentees access to resources and knowledge that are difficult to find elsewhere. After graduation, many mentees find that 
they have a more extensive network of contacts in their chosen 
field, which can lead to better job opportunities.

导师计划也可以为学员创造新的和更多的职业机会。参加导师计划可以让学员获得其他地方难以接触到的资源和知识。毕业后，许多学员发现，在所选领域，他们拥有更广泛的人脉网络，这可以带来更好的工作机会。

Mentors often have a wealth of experience and can provide 
mentees with valuable advice on which direction to take in their 
careers. The connection to such an experienced individual is often 
invaluable for a young professional.

导师通常有丰富的经验，可以为学员提供关于职业发展方向的宝贵建议。与这样一个经验丰富的人的联系，对于一个年轻的技术人员来说往往是无价的。

Mentors are often well-respected members of the industry and 
can provide mentees with recommendations or introductions that 
can help them get the job they want. As FIGURE 9 shows, 69% of 
LFX Mentorship mentees have seen their career advance or new 
career opportunities emerge due to participating in the mentorship program.

导师通常是行业中受人尊敬的成员，可以为学员提供推荐或引荐，帮助他们找到心仪的工作。如图9所示，69%的参加LFX导师计划的学员，因此获得了职业提升或新的职业机会。
