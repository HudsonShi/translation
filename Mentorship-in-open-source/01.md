简介：导师计划旨在解决的问题

Why is it necessary to have open source and LF mentorship programs? 

为什么开源与LF导师计划是有必要的？

Open source communities face a two-fold problem: building diverse communities of developers and leadership succession. Mentorship programs help to solve the problem of ensuring robust succession and growth, where many new contributors become part of the community. Just as we require offspring as a human species to guar- antee the health and continuation of our legacy and culture long after the current generation is a living memory, new entrants enable open source to breathe new life and continuity into our communities. 

开源社区面临两个方面的问题：
建设多元化的开发者社区，以及领导力继承。导师计划有助于解决不断有新的贡献者参与的情况下，如何保障稳健的继承性以及社区成长的问题。就像我们需要作为人类物种的后代来保证我们的文化和遗产在当前这一代人成为鲜活记忆之后很长一段时间内可以持续影响和延续一样，社区的新晋成员能为我们的社区持续的注入新的活力和延续性。

We invest in our communities as beneficiaries of our open source legacy by giving new developers access to knowledge and expe- rience from more experienced participants. By helping new developers to begin, mentors can help ensure that the community continues to grow and thrive long after the founders of these projects cease their direct involvement. 

我们通过让新晋的开发者从更有经验的参与者那里的获取知识和经验，作为开源遗产的受益者再投资于我们的社区中。通过协助新的开发者，导师可以协助并保证社区在项目创始人停止直接参与后很长一段时间内可以持续发展壮大。

Investing in our future by providing access to generational knowledge is not the only reason mentorship programs exist. We also wish to foster underrepresented groups—whether women, members of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities, or non-native English speakers—to improve diversity within our communities. Shuah Khan, an open source fellow and Linux kernel maintainer, explains the grounding philosophy of the mentorship program, highlighting the importance of increasing diversity in open source communities, including the Linux kernel: 
“The end goal was to have a healthy and sustainable kernel community with diverse viewpoints. Diverse communities are healthy and thriving. Having a different viewpoint in the development process keeps them healthy and relevant and serves the needs of people globally. So, improving diversity and opening up the kernel community of people of different socioeconomic backgrounds was a huge component.”

通过代代相传的知识来投资我们的未来发展并不是导师计划存在的唯一原因。 我们还希望培养一些代表性不足的群体——无论是女性、LGBTQ+ 社区成员、残疾人还是非英语母语人士——以改善我们社区的多样性。 开源研究员和 Linux 内核维护者 Shuah Khan 解释了导师计划的基本理念，强调了增加开源社区多样性的重要性，包括 Linux 内核：
         “我们的最终目标是拥有一个有包容不同观点、健康且可持续的内核社区。 多元化的社区代表健康和繁荣。 在开发过程中拥有不同的观点可以使社区保持健康和活力，并满足所有人的需求。 因此，提高多样性和吸纳不同社会经济背景的人，是社区健康发展的一个重要组成部分。“

It’s no secret that the open source community and surrounding culture are historically male-dominated. The LF is actively trying to remedy this by involving and engaging members of underrepresented minority communities, including those less economically advantaged. 

众所周知，开源社区和周边文化历来由男性主导。 LF 正在积极尝试通过让代表性不足的群体社区的成员参与进来，包括那些经济条件较差的人，来改变这个现状。

Khan, who directs the LFX Mentorship program, states that addressing diversity within the open source community is a complex societal issue involving equitable access to resources and opportunities. 

LFX导师计划的Khan指出，解决开源社区多样性的问题是一个复杂的社会问题，它涉及了获得资源和机会的公平性。


She says, “It is an issue of people not having equitable access to resources. We have to do our part to make those resources available to people equitably so that they are easier to access, easier for people to self- learn, and thus more accessible for people to get involved in open source and break down barriers. These barriers are based on your background, the language you speak, and also your financial situa- tion and various other reasons.”*

她说，“这个问题涉及到人们无法公平的获取资源。我们必须要尽一份力量，让大家可以更容易的获得和学习，能公平的使用这些资源，打破障碍参与到开源社区中来。这些障碍通常是人们的背景、语言、财务状况和其他原因。”

Providing this kind of access means recognizing these barriers and tailoring services to respect the needs of diverse communities. This can take the form of offering paid mentorships in some instances and free mentorships in others. Khan explains,

提供对导师计划有差异的访问意味着确实存在这些障碍，并调整了对应的服务以尊重不同社区的需求。 比如通过在某些情况下提供付费指导和在其他情况下提供免费指导的形式。 Khan解释说，

“The goal here is to ask, how do we make it easier for people to overcome those barriers? Can we give these folks a little lift by providing resources like free training, free webinars, and paid mentorships? We have added unpaid mentorships because not everyone wants to or can get paid to access this program, as they know our program is a limited resource, and unpaid or credit-only helps us scale it without the funding constraints. So, we try to make it accessible to different needs, career transitions, etc. Our unpaid programs are well received, and we can increase the number of mentees per project.”

“这里，我们需要回答，如何让人们更容易克服这些障碍？ 能否通过提供免费培训、免费网络研讨会和付费指导等资源来帮助这些人？ 我们增加了无偿指导，因为导师计划是一种有限的资源，不是每个人都免费的，也不是每个人都希望通过导师计划赚钱，**无偿的帮助我们在没有资金限制的情况下扩展它**。 因此，我们试图让它满足不同的需求，比如职业转型等。我们的无偿项目很受欢迎，在每个项目中的也可以增加学员人数。”

It is clear that without bringing in these diverse groups of people, open source culture becomes stagnant, putting our projects at risk in terms of their ability to retain talent and inspire new developers to join them as maintainers or core contributors. 

很明显，如果不引入这些不同的人群，开源文化就会停滞不前，使我们的项目在留住人才和激励新开发者作为维护者或核心贡献者的吸引力方面面临风险。


Angela Brown, SVP and GM of events at the LF, explains the value of DEI initiatives from the perspective of acquiring talent. She says, 

LF 高级副总裁兼活动总经理 Angela Brown 从获取人才的角度解释了 DEI 计划的价值。 她说，

*“We have all these companies that desperately need open source talent, both now and in the coming years. How do we get people prepared for that? Diversity is a big aspect because that is where you’ll find a lot of this talent since these are previously overlooked groups.”*

“我们拥有所有这些迫切需要开源人才的公司，无论是现在还是未来几年。 我们如何让人们为此做好准备？ 多样性是一个很大的方面，这是会发现很多这种人才的地方，他们也是之前被忽略的群体 。”


Not only does a lack of diversity hurt the acquisition and retention of talent, but it also translates to attracting fewer developers and is detrimental to code maintenance prospects for those projects. One mentee from the Kubernetes project discussed how mentorship and other DEI programs could help introduce under- represented perspectives into code development to the advantage of the project. As they explained,

缺乏多样性不仅会影响人才的获取和保留，导致更少的开发者的转化，最终不利于这些项目的代码维护。 Kubernetes 项目的一名学员讨论了导师计划和其他 DEI 计划如何帮助将少数派建议引入代码开发，从而使项目受益。 他们如此解释，

*“Greater representation from these groups introduces different people with different mindsets looking at a project, so when there’s a problem, we can have various approaches to it, which will help it get solved even faster.”*

“这些群体的代表性更强，可以让不同的人以不同的心态看待一个项目，所以当出现问题时，我们可以有不同的方法来解决它，这将有助于更快地解决问题。”

The roots of mentorship programs in academia 

导师计划的根源

Mentorship programs, specifically for fostering professional communities in the open source realm, have existed in the technology industry for about 17 years, with scholarly publications providing the basis for these programs dating back almost four decades. 

在技术行业内，专门为开源领域培养社区方面专业人才的导师计划已经存在了大约 17 年，学术出版物为其奠定了近 40 年的基础。

These works are used to teach Semesters of Code, an evolving undergraduate curriculum that is being taught to computer science students at Johns Hopkins University on open source software engineering by adjunct faculty member Stephen Walli, who is a principal program manager at Microsoft’s Azure Office of the CTO, a board member of the Eclipse Foundation, and a member of the LF Research Advisory Board. 

这些学术出版物用于半学年的代码学习课程，这是一门随着技术变化不断更新的本科课程，由兼职教员 Stephen Walli 向约翰霍普金斯大学计算机科学专业的学生讲解开源软件工程，他是微软 Azure 办公软件的 CTO，Eclipse 基金会的董事会成员，以及 LF 研究顾问委员会的成员。

Per Walli, the realization of the importance of mentorship programs began in the late 1980s with the research of Jean Lave, a social anthropologist at the University of California, Irvine, who introduced the concept of learning as participation in ongoing communities of practice. This challenged the conventional theories of learning and education, even to this day. 

Per Walli 意识到导师计划的重要性始于 80 年代后期，当时加州大学尔湾分校的社会人类学家 Jean Lave 的研究引入了实习的概念，即参与正在发展中的实践社区。 这挑战了传统的学习和教育理论，直到今天。

Her first work, Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life (1988), was a treatise about how ordinary people can do mathematical work in their everyday lives without even realizing it. Her second book, authored with Etienne Wenger, Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation (1991), was much more influential in education. In this book, Lave and Wenger proposed the theory that learning is a matter of legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice.

她的第一部作品《实践中的认知：日常生活中的思维、数学和文化》（1988 年）是一篇关于普通人如何在日常生活中不知不觉地使用到数学的论文。 她与 Etienne Wenger 合着的第二本书 《情境学习：合法的边缘参与》 (1991) 在教育领域影响更大。 在这本书中，Lave 和 Wenger 提出了这样一个理论，即学习是在实践的社区群体中有合法边缘参与的认知过程。

According to Lave and Wenger, learning is not something that only happens in the classroom; it is a process that occurs through social interaction in everyday life. A community of practice is a group of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly. 

根据 Lave 和 Wenger 的理论，学习不仅仅是发生在课堂上的事情；而是一个通过日常生活中的社会互动发生的过程。 实践社区是一群人，他们对所做的事情有共同的关注或热情，并在定期沟通经验，交流如何做可以学习得更好。

For example, when children are born, they enter communities
of practice, such as their family, and begin to learn the skills and practices of those communities. As they grow older, they move into new communities of practice, such as their peer groups, and continue to learn the skills and practices associated with those communities. 

举个例子，一个孩子出生，在一个家庭中生活，就像融入一个实践的社区一样，开始学习家庭里的技能和作法。 随着年龄的增长，他们进入一些新的环境，例如他们的同龄人群体，又继续学习与这些社区相关的技能和作法。

The situated learning theory describes the drivers of peripheral participation in communities of practice and is very helpful in understanding how people learn in the workplace. Many companies have started mentorship programs based on this theory to help employees learn the skills and practices they need to succeed in their jobs. 

情境学习理论描述了外部环境在实践社区中具有一定的驱动因素，这对于理解人们如何在工作场所中学习非常有帮助。 许多公司已经开始根据这一理论开展导师计划，以帮助员工学习在工作中取得成功所需的技能和作法。

Mentorship programs have also been beneficial in other settings, such as schools. In a school setting, mentorship programs allow students to learn from more experienced students or teachers. These programs can also help students develop relationships with adults who can provide support and guidance. 
In work settings, mentorship programs allow employees to learn from their experienced peers as a learning pathway for career transition and advancing skills in their areas of interest. 

导师计划在学校等其他环境中也大有裨益。 在学校环境中，导师计划引导学生向更有经验的学生或老师学习。 这些计划还可以帮助学生与可以提供支持和指导的成年人建立关系。

而在工作环境中，导师计划允许员工向经验丰富的同事学习，作为职业转型和提升对感兴趣领域技能学习的途径。

The history of mentorships in open source and the technology industry 

开源和技术领域的导师制历史

Open source mentorships date back to 2005 with the introduction of Google’s Summer of Code, a program the company has run for the last 17 years. It targets college students and provides a stipend (of $1,500 to $6,600, depending on size and location) to work on an open source project. The program has expanded to include high school, postsecondary, and graduate students. Similarly, Google’s Code-In, targeted at 13 to 17-year-olds, ran from 2010 to 2019. 
Beyond Google, other companies are releasing technology industry mentorship programs, such as Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Meta, and Red Hat. As with Summer of Code, these programs are typically 12 weeks long and take place during the summer. They are open to students at least 18 years of age who have completed one year of college. 

开源导师制可以追溯到 2005 年，当时谷歌推出了 “谷歌的代码之夏”，该公司在过去 17 年中一直在运行该计划。 它面向大学生并提供津贴（根据规模和地点，提供1,500 美元到 6,600 美元）以从事开源项目。 该计划已扩大到包括高中生、大专生和研究生。 同样，谷歌的 “谷歌Code-In” 项目针对 13 至 17 岁的人群，从 2010 年持续到 2019 年。
除了谷歌，其他公司也在发布技术行业指导计划，例如微软、IBM、亚马逊、Meta 和红帽。 与”谷歌代码之夏”一样，这些项目通常为期 12 周，并在夏季向年满 18 岁且已完成一年大学学业的学生开放。

# The genesis of mentorship at the LF 

LF 导师制的起源

The idea of mentorship at the LF initially came about to bring maintainers into the fold for its Linux kernel project. As with many open source projects, the kernel’s developer population has  grown organically—it is not a traditional hire and talent placement scenario. The need to replace developers over time is crucial to the stability and longevity of the project, and mentorship is one way to achieve this. The organization decided to become more intentional about how it could help new developers get up to speed and become productive members of the open source community. 

LF 的指导思想最初是为了拉动开发者参与其 Linux 内核项目的维护。 与许多开源项目一样，内核的开发人员数量已经实现了自然增长——不依赖传统的招聘方式。 随着时间的推移，开发者更迭对于项目的稳定性和成长性至关重要，而导师制度是实现这一目标的一种方式。 因此，组织决定更加专注于如何帮助新开发者加快成为开源社区高效产出的成员。

The pilot mentorship program launched within the kernel community in 2019 had a few simple objectives: to help new developers feel welcome, learn the ropes, and accept their first code contributions. Khan identified these objectives and the goal of increasing diversity. She says, 
*“We identified three reasons for starting the program: diversity, community health, and sustainability. You have to inject new talent and bring in people, new developers that can take over at some point from the aging maintainer population and step into these important roles. So, we felt that the best approach at the time would be having these developers trained by maintainer experts in those areas.”*

2019 年在内核社区内启动的试点导师计划有几个简单的目标：让新的开发者有归属感、摸到门道并接受他们的第一个代码贡献。 Khan说，
*“我们确定了启动该计划的三个原因：多样性、社区健康和可持续性。 必须注入新的人才并引入新的开发人员，他们可以在某个时候接替退休的维护人员并担任这些重要角色。 因此，我们认为最好的方法是让这些开发人员接受这些维护专家的培训。”*

Khan looked at previous examples of mentorship programs at other open source organizations and wanted to broaden mentorships outside of their student-centric focus by inviting industry professionals into the program. This also required unique accommodations that similar programs only previously had. Khan adds, 
*“I talked to people running mentorship programs at the time, such as Outreachy and Google Summer of Code, and how they viewed the shortcomings of those programs. One part that came up as a big thing was that it would be helpful to have it as a part- time program; thus, we added that early on. We also decided not to restrict it to students because career transition is very important. And I chose to run three sessions, spring, summer, and fall, like a college or university, so that it would be accessible to people globally.*

Khan 查看了其他开源组织以前的导师计划案例，并希望通过邀请产业界的专业人士加入该计划来扩大之前以学生为重点的指导。 这也是需要单独进行协调，之前并无先例。 Khan补充道，
*“我与当时运行导师计划的人进行了交谈，例如 Outreachy 和 Google Summer of Code的相应人员，以及他们如何看待这些计划的缺点。 把该计划作为一个兼职项目是个很好的事情； 因此，我们很早就添加了这一点。 我们还决定不将其仅限于学生，因为职业转型非常重要。 我选择举办春季、夏季和秋季三个课程，就像学院或大学一样，以便所有的人都可以使用它。*


*So, for example, the spring session is probably the one that people from the southern hemisphere could participate in because it is their summer. The summer session would be for other people and students. For others, they could fit into a three-month or six-month program.”*

*例如，春季班可能是南半球的人可以参加，因为那是他们的夏天。 暑期班是为其他人和学生准备的。 对于其他人，他们可以参加为期三个月或六个月的课程。”*

Another approach to attract industry professionals was opening the program to anyone, regardless of employment status. As Khan explains, 
*“We don’t require applicants to be unemployed; they can be fully employed, part-time, or of any kind of status. We simply say if you can spend 20 to 40 hours a week learning and advancing your skills, you’re welcome to apply to our program.”*
Khan also explains why they chose not to restrict participants based on demographics: 
*“Other programs restrict their mentorships to students only or women and LGBTQ+. Some of these are 100% diverse in their population, which is excellent. However, they are fishing from a smaller pond to begin with, which purposefully restricts the size of their addressable communities and programs. We didn’t want to do that; we’re open to everyone.”*
The program, now known officially as LFX Mentorships, has since been expanded beyond the Linux kernel to include other open source projects under the LF umbrella, such as Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), Hyperledger, Open Mainframe Project, ELISA, Zephyr, RISC-V, and Automotive Grade Linux. (**FIGURE 2**) 

另一种吸引产业界专业人士的方法是向任何人开放该计划，无论其就业状况如何。 Khan解释：
“我们不要求申请人脱产； 他们可以是全职、兼职或任何身份。 我们只是说，如果你每周能花 20 到 40 个小时学习和提高你的技能，欢迎你申请我们的项目。”
Khan 还解释了为什么他们选择不根据人口统计的数据来限制参与者：
“其他项目将他们的指导仅限于学生或女性和 LGBTQ+。 其中一些在其人口中 100% 多样化，这非常好。 然而，他们面向比较垂直的人群，这刻意的限制了对应的社区和项目的规模。 我们不想那样做； 我们向所有人开放。”

该计划现在正式称为 LFX Mentorships，此后已扩展到 Linux 内核之外，包括 LF 旗下的其他开源项目，例如云原生基金会 (CNCF)、Hyperledger、Open Mainframe Project、ELISA、Zephyr、RISC -V 和AGL等社区和项目。 （图 2）
