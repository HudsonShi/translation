The roots of mentorship programs in academia 
导师计划的根源

Mentorship programs, specifically for fostering professional communities in the open source realm, have existed in the technology industry for about 17 years, with scholarly publications providing the basis for these programs dating back almost four decades. 
在技术行业内，专门为开源领域培养社区方面专业人才的导师计划已经存在了大约 17 年，学术出版物为其奠定了近 40 年的基础。

These works are used to teach Semesters of Code, an evolving undergraduate curriculum that is being taught to computer science students at Johns Hopkins University on open source software engineering by adjunct faculty member Stephen Walli, who is a principal program manager at Microsoft’s Azure Office of the CTO, a board member of the Eclipse Foundation, and a member of the LF Research Advisory Board. 
这些学术出版物用于半学年的代码学习课程，这是一门随着技术变化不断更新的本科课程，由兼职教员 Stephen Walli 向约翰霍普金斯大学计算机科学专业的学生讲解开源软件工程，他是微软 Azure 办公软件的 CTO，Eclipse 基金会的董事会成员，以及 LF 研究顾问委员会的成员。

Per Walli, the realization of the importance of mentorship programs began in the late 1980s with the research of Jean Lave, a social anthropologist at the University of California, Irvine, who introduced the concept of learning as participation in ongoing communities of practice. This challenged the conventional theories of learning and education, even to this day. 

Per Walli 意识到导师计划的重要性始于 80 年代后期，当时加州大学尔湾分校的社会人类学家 Jean Lave 的研究引入了实习的概念，即参与正在发展中的实践社区。 这挑战了传统的学习和教育理论，直到今天。

Her first work, Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life (1988), was a treatise about how ordinary people can do mathematical work in their everyday lives without even realizing it. Her second book, authored with Etienne Wenger, Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation (1991), was much more influential in education. In this book, Lave and Wenger proposed the theory that learning is a matter of legitimate peripheral participation in communities of practice.

她的第一部作品《实践中的认知：日常生活中的思维、数学和文化》（1988 年）是一篇关于普通人如何在日常生活中不知不觉地使用到数学的论文。 她与 Etienne Wenger 合着的第二本书 《情境学习：合法的边缘参与》 (1991) 在教育领域影响更大。 在这本书中，Lave 和 Wenger 提出了这样一个理论，即学习是在实践的社区群体中有合法边缘参与的认知过程。

According to Lave and Wenger, learning is not something that only happens in the classroom; it is a process that occurs through social interaction in everyday life. A community of practice is a group of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly. 
根据 Lave 和 Wenger 的理论，学习不仅仅是发生在课堂上的事情；而是一个通过日常生活中的社会互动发生的过程。 实践社区是一群人，他们对所做的事情有共同的关注或热情，并在定期沟通经验，交流如何做可以学习得更好。

For example, when children are born, they enter communities
of practice, such as their family, and begin to learn the skills and practices of those communities. As they grow older, they move into new communities of practice, such as their peer groups, and continue to learn the skills and practices associated with those communities. 
举个例子，一个孩子出生，在一个家庭中生活，就像融入一个实践的社区一样，开始学习家庭里的技能和作法。 随着年龄的增长，他们进入一些新的环境，例如他们的同龄人群体，又继续学习与这些社区相关的技能和作法。

The situated learning theory describes the drivers of peripheral participation in communities of practice and is very helpful in understanding how people learn in the workplace. Many companies have started mentorship programs based on this theory to help employees learn the skills and practices they need to succeed in their jobs. 
情境学习理论描述了外部环境在实践社区中具有一定的驱动因素，这对于理解人们如何在工作场所中学习非常有帮助。 许多公司已经开始根据这一理论开展导师计划，以帮助员工学习在工作中取得成功所需的技能和作法。

Mentorship programs have also been beneficial in other settings, such as schools. In a school setting, mentorship programs allow students to learn from more experienced students or teachers. These programs can also help students develop relationships with adults who can provide support and guidance. 
In work settings, mentorship programs allow employees to learn from their experienced peers as a learning pathway for career transition and advancing skills in their areas of interest. 
导师计划在学校等其他环境中也大有裨益。 在学校环境中，导师计划引导学生向更有经验的学生或老师学习。 这些计划还可以帮助学生与可以提供支持和指导的成年人建立关系。

而在工作环境中，导师计划允许员工向经验丰富的同事学习，作为职业转型和提升对感兴趣领域技能学习的途径。
