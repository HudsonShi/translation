Introduction
============

> Corporate participation in open source has reached an all-time high
> and continues to grow as organizations realize the value of consuming
> and contributing to open source projects
>
> (**FIGURE 1**). In addition, the nature of corporate (also called
> enterprise) participation continues to evolve as organizations
> increasingly discover that open sourcing proprietary technologies can
> create new sources of value and more robust product ecosystems.
>
> Enterprise open source development has challenges, which we discussed
> in detail in "[[A Deep Dive into Open Source
> Program]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices)
> [[Offices: Structure, Roles, Responsibilities, and
> Challenges]{.underline}](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/research/a-deep-dive-into-open-source-program-offices)."
>
> The enterprise open source journey is challenging (**FIGURE 2**), and
> an organization needs to address this to build its open source
> leadership. If the organization has a clear plan to implement
>
> internal practices and address those known challenges, the journey
> becomes easier. For instance, the Linux Kernel is the largest
> collaborative software project in the world, and getting involved in
> the development process can be overwhelming.
>
> If you are one of the organizations that rely on the Linux Kernel for
> their products and services, investing time and resources into
> improving your internal development abilities, contributions process,
> and syncing your development with the upstream project can pay off
> immensely in the long run.
>
> Fortunately, since so many organizations and individuals have been
> successful at contributing to the Linux Kernel, there is a clear path
> to improve your own Linux Kernel contributions and aim for a
> leadership role.

-   Improving code quality

-   Supporting faster development cycles

-   Producing more stable code to serve as the base for products

-   Improving the organization's reputation in critical open source
    communities

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Hire developers from the project's community
============================================

> This critical step allows your organization to gain skills and
> recognition immediately. Hiring two or three people is a great start
> toward making a noticeable impact on a large project, such as the
> Linux Kernel, attracting further hires and allowing enough resources
> to mentor existing junior developers.
>
> It is crucial to align corporate interests with individual interests.
>
> It will be hard to motivate a senior open source developer to work on
> a given project when their interests do not match those of their
> employers. For instance, a memory management expert may
>
> not be interested in working on file systems; therefore, finding a
> match in interests is critical.

 Support and allocate time for upstream contributions
====================================================

> The core principle for hiring open source developers is to support an
> organization's open source strategy, development, and upstream
> activities; however, in most cases, there is the expectation that open
> source developers will need to be available to support product teams
> due to their expertise and influence
>
> in their respective open source projects. It is also common for
> product teams to exercise their influence in an attempt to hijack the
> time of the open source developers by having them work on product
> development as much as possible. If this happens,
>
> many open source developers will head to the door, seeking new
> opportunities that allows them to work on their upstream project
> before an organization realizes what just happened.
>
> **FIGURE 3**

BENEFITS OF UPSTREAMING CODE
----------------------------

> ![](media/image38.png)Lower maintenance efforts for internally managed
> code, i.e., minimizes technical debt.
>
> Upstreamed code becomes visible to others and receives peer review and
> feedback, leading to improvements.
>
> Upstream contributions provide stability to the project. They send a
> signal that the project is useful and important, which helps attract
> new contributors.
>
> Builds a positive relationship between the contributing organization
> and the project community.
>
> Upstreaming code is an effective way to provide technical leadership
> and influence the project.
>
> Upstreaming contributes to easier compliance and improved security due
> to centralizing code in upstream repos.
>
> Upstream contributions are an effective means of ensuring stability in
> a company's software supply chain.
>
> Helps organizations recruit talent from projects and retain their own
> developers by engaging them with the open source innovation engine.
>
> []{#_bookmark3 .anchor}Therefore, creating and maintaining a
> separation of upstream work and product work is essential. In other
> words, a followed practice is to provide open source developers with
> guaranteed time to meet their upstream aspirations and
> responsibilities, especially if they are maintainers. For junior
> developers, or other internal developers using open source in product
> components, such interactions with the upstream community will
> increase their language, communication, and technical skills. In the
> absence of such an upstream time guarantee, it is easy for these team
> members to become an extension of product teams, resulting in their
> upstream focus drying up in favor of product development.

Create a mentorship program
===========================

> Set up a mentorship program where senior, experienced open source
> developers mentor junior, less experienced developers. Typically, a
> mentorship program runs for three to six months, during which the
> mentor supervises the mentee's work, assigns tasks, and ensures proper
> results. The mentor also conducts code reviews and provides feedback
> on anything the mentee produces before the mentee pushes the code to
> the upstream project.
>
> This exercise aims to increase the number of developers contributing
> code to the upstream project and improve individual effectiveness by
> increasing the quality of code and the percentage of code accepted
> into the upstream project. In general, four to five mentees should
> work with a given mentor, and, ideally, they should work in the same
> area as the mentor to make code reviews more efficient.

 Formalize open source human resources tracking & performance metrics
====================================================================

> Mature open source organizations almost always have an open source
> developer track in their HR system. So, individuals hired as open
> source developers have a good sense of how their careers will progress
> within the organization. Additionally, organizations often need to
> adjust their performance-based bonuses and metrics to include goals
> related to open source development work. Closed source developers'
> performance metrics are often different from those of open source
> developers. For example, if an open source developer advocates for the
> implementation of
>
> a given feature, successfully gathers interest, and volunteers to
> write the code, how would they be rated, especially if they may not
> have written a single line of code?
>
> Finally, organizations should allow a work-from-home (WFH) policy for
> open source developers regardless of the general corporate policy.
> During COVID-19, we witnessed organizations institute WFH policies to
> allow employees to be productive while under quarantine. It was a
> fascinating experiment for WFH policies, as organizations continued to
> operate, innovate, and produce, even though most of their employees
> worked from home. A WFH policy is almost mandatory in the open source
> world because open source developers are located worldwide, making
> hiring and retaining them easier.

Offer training
==============

> It is only possible for organizations to hire some of the senior and
> most expert developers. They are always looking for ways to increase
> the competence of their developers in a given technical domain;
> therefore, in addition to specialized
>
> training, organizations need to offer training on the open source
> development model and the basic concepts of open source legal
> compliance.
>
> Sample training courses include:

-   An open source development methodology course that teaches staff new
    to open source how open source development works and how to get best
    engaged with the project community

-   An open source compliance course that teaches staff the basics of
    compliance principles and open source

> licensing. The course often includes modules covering the
> organization's policy and process.
>
> The Linux Foundation offers several technical training courses
> specific to open source technologies and several
> [[nontechnical]{.underline}](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog)
> [[courses]{.underline}](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog),
> such as this free online open source compliance training for
> developers.

 Participate in and host open source events
==========================================

> Mature open source organizations support and encourage their
> developers to host, attend, and participate in open source conferences
> and events, including local community meetups, hackathons, and
> summits. Such participation helps open source developers connect
> personally with their peers, build relationships, and participate in
> technical discussions that guide the direction of the respective open
> source projects.
>
> As an organization that uses and adopts open source software, it is
> highly recommended to facilitate for your open source developers the
> process of attending and presenting at open source events. You can
> also sponsor big and small events
>
> to increase external visibility within the open source global
> community or simply target events tailored for specific open source
> projects. As a bonus benefit, such events are also great venues to
> look for talent.

Provide a flexible IT infrastructure
====================================

> Provide a flexible IT infrastructure that allows open source
> developers to communicate and work with the open source and Linux
> Kernel communities without any challenges. Additionally, set up an
> internal IT infrastructure that matches the tools used externally to
> help bridge the gap between internal teams and the Kernel community or
> any other open source project community for that purpose.
>
> []{#_bookmark5 .anchor}Open source development uses three primary
> domains of IT services: knowledge sharing (wikis, collaborative
> editing
>
> platforms, and public websites), communication and problem solving
> (mailing lists, forums, and real-time chat), and code development and
> distribution (code repositories and bug tracking). Making some or all
> of these tools available internally properly supports open source
> development. However, this might conflict with existing
> organization-wide IT policies. If so, it is vital to resolve these
> conflicts and allow open source developers to use familiar tools.

Track developer code contributions
==================================

> Create an internal system to keep track of developer contributions and
> impact. Contributions can include upstream development, supporting
> product teams, knowledge transfer (mentoring, training), visibility
> (publications, talks), launching new open source projects, and
> establishing internal collaboration projects with other teams or
> groups.
>
> With this data, you can compare contributions from various internal
> development teams to identify where source code contributions are
> coming from.
>
> For instance, you can use these metrics to compare your performance to
> other organizations involved in the Kernel ecosystem. This approach
> helps better inform you about the overall developer ecosystem for the
> project. In addition, these metrics provide a much better idea of your
> strengths and weaknesses and can help inform your overall development
> strategy.

 Identify focus areas with a broad impact
========================================

> Contribute to and focus on areas that benefit more than one business
> unit or more than one product. This contribution model, driven by the
> criticality of software components, allows you to provide value and
> show return on investment
>
> across multiple business units, increasing your chances for more
> funding and support.

Foster internal collaboration
=============================

> Create collaboration projects with other business units that use the
> specific open source projects in their products. These collaborations
> can take one or more of many forms:

-   Deliver training to their developers.

-   Run a workshop on a specific topic or problem.

-   Develop new functionality.

-   Troubleshoot and resolve issues and bugs.

-   Upstream existing code for which they lack resources.

-   Help get them off an old fork and onto a mainline version.

> These collaborations aim to help the product teams understand their
> needs and fulfill their product goals via open source enablement.

Implement inner sourcing practices
==================================

> Inner sourcing is the application of open source methodologies to
> development projects inside the organization. The goal is to incubate
> the same capabilities within the enterprise as those
>
> in the open source community and to foster new employee-to- employee
> relationships that are cross-functional and touch on multiple product
> domains.
>
> Open source principles work well on large-scale projects distributed
> across an enterprise. Many Fortune 500 organizations have adopted them
> externally and internally for the same reasons: faster releases,
> improved quality, increased innovation and communications, information
> sharing, reduced costs, greater and more effective collaboration, and
> increased employee morale and retention.
>
> ![](media/image44.png)Inner sourcing prepares organizations to work
> effectively with external open source communities. It encourages
> employees to interact with colleagues elsewhere and with external
> community members without switching contexts. In addition, new
> employees familiar with this development model may integrate more
>
> quickly into established workflows. Finally, business partners are
> probably already using many of these development practices, so when an
> organization adopts inner sourcing practices, it is also strengthening
> its integration with the commercial ecosystem.

Recommendations and lessons learned
===================================

### Be patient

> It takes considerable time to grow internal open source expertise. The
> goal from an enterprise perspective is to find people with enough peer
> recognition to be influential in the community. There are typically
> three pillars to this: domain expertise, open source methodology, and
> working practices.

### Shift to a more collaborative environment

> Internal organization dynamics must be favorable to open source
> efforts. Implementing these practices requires a shift from
> traditional software development practices to a more open and
> collaborative mindset. As an open source leader inside
>
> your organization, you will face several challenges in funding
> resources, justifying ROI, getting upstream focus, etc. These often
> require a major shift in mindset and a lot of education up the command
> chain.

### Embrace a flexible IT infrastructure

> These open source practices require an IT infrastructure free from
> many limiting IT policies and a computing environment that supports
> open source development.

### Adopt proper success metrics

> Proper open source metrics drive the desired development behavior.
> Unfortunately, the traditional metrics often used in product
> organizations only apply in the context of open source development.
> For example, we have had multiple instances of the upstream
> implementation of desired functionality because of OSG developers that
> lobby for support from the community.
>
> In this case, the number of changesets or lines of code does not
> matter as much, as the technical leadership team members provide to
> get code upstream and reduce our downstream maintenance efforts. The
> metrics we track account for things like this.

### Use a lightweight approval process

> Organizations have transitioned from highly complex and cumbersome
> policies to a more straightforward approach for receiving, reviewing,
> and approving source code contributions. Dedicated open source teams
> often receive blanket approval to contribute to open source projects.
> This is not the case for other groups, which need different approval
> levels depending on the nature of the contributed code (e.g., simple
> bug fixes, code to improve existing functionality, code that offers
> new functionality, or starting a new project). This is a function of
> the balance between all parties involved: legal, engineering, and open
> source.

### Share information

> The organization must share information and priorities across
> different divisions. To illustrate this, assume you are on an open
> source team and request to support the implementation of a driver, but
> you cannot access the hardware manual and
>
> instructions. This situation sounds a bit like playing darts with the
> lights off; therefore, information sharing is critical to successful
> internal collaborations between the open source teams and everyone
> else.

### Make strategic contributions

> Focus your contributions on upstream projects that would directly
> benefit the organization's strategy and products. In open source
> development, it is easy to get carried away by hopping between
> different exciting projects. However, in an enterprise setting where
> the open source group is a cost center, your driving force should be
> to focus on open source projects that support product development.
> Open source teams often perform a yearly review of the product
> portfolio they support and focus their involvement on open source
> projects commonly used across as many products as possible. Such a
> methodology drives priorities and is a great way to remain focused on
> what's essential, justifiable, and fundable.

###  Partner with product teams

> Be the upstream partner for product teams; they often feel like they
> are working inside a pressure cooker, especially in a consumer
> electronics environment. They often seem
>
> understaffed, need more critical resources to support parallel
> upstream development, and are under constant pressure for feature
> delivery within tight schedules. In such an environment, it is easy to
> overlook the benefit of upstreaming in favor of short-term time
> savings, which can, unfortunately, lead to technical debt that has a
> higher cost in the long term.
>
> Open source teams can help by being a partner that focuses on
> delivering the necessary code upstream, reducing this technical debt.
>
> ![](media/image49.png)**FIGURE 5**

RECOMMENDED PRACTICES FOR CONTRIBUTING TO OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS
--------------------------------------------------------------

> Design & implement with upstreaming in mind to increase the likelihood
> of patch acceptance.
>
> Ensure the contribution improves or introduces functionality that is
> useful for a broad base of users.
>
> Stay involved in upstream development post merging with the upstream
> project.
>
> Document the code to make it easier to understand and to lower the
> barrier for new contributors.
>
> Upstream for the right reasons.
>
> Upstreaming is not a code retirement strategy.
>
> Listen to feedback, and act upon it---rework the code based on the
> peer review process.
>
> Follow proper coding style, and secure code guidelines.
>
> Follow the processes set by the project for submitting code, new
> features, etc.

### Grow open source talent

> Grow open source talent in specific technology areas relevant to your
> products. Hiring a few resources from outside the organization is
> easy, but this approach has several limitations. The alternative
> approach is to convert your existing developers into open source
> contributors via training on the technical domain and open source
> methodology. You can then pair these developers with a mentor to
> further expand their skills.
>
> Encourage developers outside the open source team to learn from and
> contribute to the open source community. We provide as much help as we
> can with upstream code contributions.
>
> Still, we need more resources and sometimes need a deeper
> understanding of products that might be necessary to identify where we
> can adequately upstream code. Better involvement in the open source
> community from teams outside our own allows us to get more critical
> code upstream and improves our ability to interact with the community.

Conclusion
==========

> You must earn open source leadership, but you can lose it through a
> lack of participation. Regular, ongoing participation and contribution
> are the only ways to ensure your organization maintains open source
> leadership.
>
> Hopefully, this paper makes the task of improving your enterprise's
> open source practices more manageable. Following some of the
> recommended practices will go a long way toward developing internal
> open source expertise. You can leverage this expertise to improve your
> products and services and reduce
>
> the cost of code maintenance. Many organizations have had considerable
> success through the use of these strategies.

MASTERING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE
------------------------------

> Master open source software requires you to mastering the three
> critical Cs:
>
> **Consumption **
>
> **Compliance **
>
> **Contribution **
>
> Establish internal infrastructure to enable proper practices for open
> source software consumption: policy, process, checklists, and
> training.
>
> Enable open source compliance practices within your development
> process to ensure proper fulfillment of open source license
> obligations once products ship.
>
> Enable your developers to engage within open source projects via a
> policy and a lightweight process and access to legal support. Provide
> training on open source development models and best practices.
>
> **FIGURE 8**

ELEVEN TIPS FOR MASTERING:
--------------------------

> **OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS**
>
> How can you build a healthy environment for open source contributions
> within your organization?

1.  Establish a policy and process to guide open source contributions.

2.  Set up a team to oversee approvals for all open source
    contributions.
