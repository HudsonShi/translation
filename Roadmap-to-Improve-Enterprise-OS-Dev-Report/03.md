Hire developers from the project's community

============================================

从项目社区雇佣开发人员

=====================

This critical step allows your organization to gain skills and
recognition immediately. Hiring two or three people is a great start
toward making a noticeable impact on a large project, such as the
Linux Kernel, attracting further hires and allowing enough resources
to mentor existing junior developers.

It is crucial to align corporate interests with individual interests.

It will be hard to motivate a senior open source developer to work on
a given project when their interests do not match those of their
employers. For instance, a memory management expert may

not be interested in working on file systems; therefore, finding a
match in interests is critical.

这是可以让你的组织立即获得技能和认可的关键步骤。想对一个大型项目（例如Linux
内核）产生明显的影响，雇佣两三个人是一个很好的开始，这样可以吸引更多的员工，
并有足够的资源来指导已有的初级开发人员。

让个人兴趣与公司利益保持一致非常重要。

当高级开源开发人员的兴趣与雇主的不匹配时，会很难激励他们在被指定的项目上工作。
例如一位内存管理专家可能对在文件系统工作根本不感兴趣；因此，找兴趣的匹配点是
至关重要的。

 Support and allocate time for upstream contributions

====================================================

支持并分配时间用于上游贡献

========================

The core principle for hiring open source developers is to support an
organization's open source strategy, development, and upstream
activities; however, in most cases, there is the expectation that open
source developers will need to be available to support product teams
due to their expertise and influence

in their respective open source projects. It is also common for
product teams to exercise their influence in an attempt to hijack the
time of the open source developers by having them work on product
development as much as possible. If this happens,

many open source developers will head to the door, seeking new
opportunities that allows them to work on their upstream project
before an organization realizes what just happened.

雇用开源开发人员的核心目的是支持该组织的开源战略、开发和上游活动；然而，在大
多数情况下，由于开源开发人员的专业知识和影响力，他们也需要在对应的开源项目中
为产品团队提供支持。同样常见的是产品团队行使他们的影响力来试图来抢夺开源开发
人员的时间、让其尽可能多地参与产品开发。如果发生这种情况，许多开源开发人员会
直奔门口离开，去寻求容许他们在上游项目上工作的新机会，甚至是在这个组织意识到
发生了什么之前。

BENEFITS OF UPSTREAMING CODE
----------------------------

上游代码的好处
-------------

Lower maintenance efforts for internally managed
code, i.e., minimizes technical debt.

Upstreamed code becomes visible to others and receives peer review and
feedback, leading to improvements.

Upstream contributions provide stability to the project. They send a
signal that the project is useful and important, which helps attract
new contributors.

Builds a positive relationship between the contributing organization
and the project community.

Upstreaming code is an effective way to provide technical leadership
and influence the project.

Upstreaming contributes to easier compliance and improved security due
to centralizing code in upstream repos.

Upstream contributions are an effective means of ensuring stability in
a company's software supply chain.

Helps organizations recruit talent from projects and retain their own
developers by engaging them with the open source innovation engine.

减少内部托管代码的维护工作量，例如最大限度地减少了技术债。

上游的代码对其他人可见，接收同行评审和反馈，进而可以优化改进。

上游贡献为项目提供了稳定性。它们发出了该项目是有用的和重要的信号，这有
助于吸引新的贡献者。

在贡献组织和项目社区之间建立积极正向的关系。

上游代码是构建技术领导力和影响项目的有效方法。

由于将代码集中在上游项目仓库中，上游贡献有助于更容易地实现合规遵从和提高
安全性。

上游贡献是保护公司软件供应链稳定的有效手段。

帮助组织从项目中招募人才，同时通过让组织现有的开放人员参与开源创新引擎来吸
引留住他们。

Therefore, creating and maintaining a
separation of upstream work and product work is essential. In other
words, a followed practice is to provide open source developers with
guaranteed time to meet their upstream aspirations and
responsibilities, especially if they are maintainers. For junior
developers, or other internal developers using open source in product
components, such interactions with the upstream community will
increase their language, communication, and technical skills. In the
absence of such an upstream time guarantee, it is easy for these team
members to become an extension of product teams, resulting in their
upstream focus drying up in favor of product development.

因此，创建和维护上游工作和产品工作之间的隔离是必不可少的。换句话说，一个可
遵循的实践是为开源开发人员提供有保证的时间来满足他们的上游意愿和责任，特别
是如果他们担任项目维护者。对于初级开发人员，或者其他在产品组件中使用开源的
内部开发人员，与上游社区的这种互动将提高他们的语言、沟通和技术能力。在缺乏
这样的上游时间保证的情况下，这些团队成员很容易成为产品团队的延伸，导致他们
的上游投入枯竭转而支持产品开发。

Create a mentorship program
===========================

创建导师计划
===========

Set up a mentorship program where senior, experienced open source
developers mentor junior, less experienced developers. Typically, a
mentorship program runs for three to six months, during which the
mentor supervises the mentee's work, assigns tasks, and ensures proper
results. The mentor also conducts code reviews and provides feedback
on anything the mentee produces before the mentee pushes the code to
the upstream project.

建立一个导师计划，让资深的、有经验的开源开发人员来引导初级的、经验较少的开发
人员。通常情况下，导师计划持续3至6个月，在此期间，导师将监督学员的工作，分配
任务，并确保适当的结果。在学员将代码推送到上游项目之前，导师也会进行代码审查
并对学员的产出内容提供反馈。

This exercise aims to increase the number of developers contributing
code to the upstream project and improve individual effectiveness by
increasing the quality of code and the percentage of code accepted
into the upstream project. In general, four to five mentees should
work with a given mentor, and, ideally, they should work in the same
area as the mentor to make code reviews more efficient.

这种练习的目的是通过提高代码质量和上游项目接受代码的比例来提升为上游项目贡献
代码的开发人员数量和个人效率。一般来说，4到5名学员与一位指定的导师一起工作，
理想情况下，他们应该与导师在同一领域工作从而可以让代码审查更高效。

Formalize open source human resources tracking & performance metrics
====================================================================

正式制定开源人力资源跟踪和绩效指标
================================

Mature open source organizations almost always have an open source
developer track in their HR system. So, individuals hired as open
source developers have a good sense of how their careers will progress
within the organization. Additionally, organizations often need to
adjust their performance-based bonuses and metrics to include goals
related to open source development work. Closed source developers'
performance metrics are often different from those of open source
developers. For example, if an open source developer advocates for the
implementation of
a given feature, successfully gathers interest, and volunteers to
write the code, how would they be rated, especially if they may not
have written a single line of code?

成熟的开源组织几乎总是在他们的HR系统中拥有一个开源开发人员赛道，这样被雇用为
开源开发人员的个人对他们在组织内的职业发展有很好的了解。此外，组织往往需要调
整其基于绩效的奖金和指标来包括与开源开发工作相关的目标。闭源开发人员的性能指
标通常与开源开发人员的性能指标不同。例如，如果一个开源开发人员倡导实现一个特
定的功能，成功地吸引到社区兴趣并有志愿者们自愿编写代码，那么他们将如何被评价，
特别是如果他们自己可能没有编写一行代码的话？

Finally, organizations should allow a work-from-home (WFH) policy for
open source developers regardless of the general corporate policy.
During COVID-19, we witnessed organizations institute WFH policies to
allow employees to be productive while under quarantine. It was a
fascinating experiment for WFH policies, as organizations continued to
operate, innovate, and produce, even though most of their employees
worked from home. A WFH policy is almost mandatory in the open source
world because open source developers are located worldwide, making
hiring and retaining them easier.

最后，组织应该忽略常规的公司政策，允许开源开发人员远程办公。在COVID-19期间，
我们目睹组织制定了远程办公政策，以允许员工在隔离期间保持高效产出。对于远程办
公政策来说，这是一次引人入胜的实验，因为组织继续运营、创新和生产，尽管他们的
大多数员工都在家远程办公。远程办公政策在开源世界几乎是强制性的，因为开源开发
人员分布在世界各地，使得招聘和留住他们变得更加容易。
