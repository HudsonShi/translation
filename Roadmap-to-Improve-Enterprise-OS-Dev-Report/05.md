Implement inner sourcing practices
==================================

Inner sourcing is the application of open source methodologies to
development projects inside the organization. The goal is to incubate
the same capabilities within the enterprise as those

in the open source community and to foster new employee-to- employee
relationships that are cross-functional and touch on multiple product
domains.

Open source principles work well on large-scale projects distributed
across an enterprise. Many Fortune 500 organizations have adopted them
externally and internally for the same reasons: faster releases,
improved quality, increased innovation and communications, information
sharing, reduced costs, greater and more effective collaboration, and
increased employee morale and retention.

effectively with external open source communities. It encourages
employees to interact with colleagues elsewhere and with external
community members without switching contexts. In addition, new
employees familiar with this development model may integrate more

quickly into established workflows. Finally, business partners are
probably already using many of these development practices, so when an
organization adopts inner sourcing practices, it is also strengthening
its integration with the commercial ecosystem.
