Offer training
==============

培训支持
==============

It is only possible for organizations to hire some of the senior and
most expert developers. They are always looking for ways to increase
the competence of their developers in a given technical domain;
therefore, in addition to specialized training, organizations need to offer training on the open source
development model and the basic concepts of open source legal
compliance.

组织只可能聘任一些高级的、专家级的开发人员。他们总是在寻找方法来提升开发者在特定领域的能力。因此，在专业化培训之外，组织还需要开展关于开源开发模型和开源合规基本概念的培训。

Sample training courses include:

举例来说，培训课程包括：

- An open source development methodology course that teaches staff new
    to open source how open source development works and how to get best
    engaged with the project community

- 开放源码开发方法论课程：指导员工开源项目如何进行初始开发，以及如何最好的参与到项目社区中；

- An open source compliance course that teaches staff the basics of
    compliance principles and open source licensing. The course often
    includes modules covering the organization's policy and process.

- 开放源码合规课程，教导员工遵循开源原则和开源许可的基础知识。该课程通常涵盖了组织政策和流程的内容。

The Linux Foundation offers several technical training courses
specific to open source technologies and several
[[nontechnical]](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog)
[[courses]](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog),
such as this free online open source compliance training for
developers.

Linux基金会提供了一些针对开放源码的技术培训课程和非技术课程，例如上述面向开发人员的开源合规免费在线课程[[nontechnical]](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/full-catalog)

 Participate in and host open source events
==========================================

 参与并主持开源活动
==========================================

Mature open source organizations support and encourage their
developers to host, attend, and participate in open source conferences
and events, including local community meetups, hackathons, and
summits. Such participation helps open source developers connect
personally with their peers, build relationships, and participate in
technical discussions that guide the direction of the respective open
source projects.

成熟的开源组织会对支持并鼓励自己的开发人员主持、参加和参与开源会议和活动，包括本地社区聚会、黑客马拉松和峰会。这种参与有助于开源开发人员与他们的同行建立个人联系，打造关系圈，参与并指导与各自开源项目有关的技术讨论。

As an organization that uses and adopts open source software, it is
highly recommended to facilitate for your open source developers the
process of attending and presenting at open source events. You can
also sponsor big and small events to increase external visibility within the open source global
community or simply target events tailored for specific open source
projects. As a bonus benefit, such events are also great venues to
look for talent.

作为开源软件使用者，强烈建议组织为其开源开发人员到开源活动中参加和展示提供支持。也可以赞助大大小小的活动
以提升在全球化开源社区中的知名度，亦或者针对特定开源项目量身定制活动。作为额外的惊喜，此类活动也是发现人才的好去处。

Provide a flexible IT infrastructure
====================================

提供灵活的IT基础设施
====================================

Provide a flexible IT infrastructure that allows open source
developers to communicate and work with the open source and Linux
Kernel communities without any challenges. Additionally, set up an
internal IT infrastructure that matches the tools used externally to
help bridge the gap between internal teams and the Kernel community or
any other open source project community for that purpose.

提供灵活的IT基础设施，使开源开发人员能够毫无阻碍地与开源社区和Linux内核社区进行联系和工作。此外，建立一个与外部使用的工具相匹配的内部IT基础设施，以减少内部团队与内核社区或任何其他开源项目社区之间的距离感。

[]{#_bookmark5 .anchor}Open source development uses three primary
domains of IT services: knowledge sharing (wikis, collaborative
editing platforms, and public websites), communication and problem solving
(mailing lists, forums, and real-time chat), and code development and
distribution (code repositories and bug tracking). Making some or all
of these tools available internally properly supports open source
development. However, this might conflict with existing
organization-wide IT policies. If so, it is vital to resolve these
conflicts and allow open source developers to use familiar tools.

开源开发所使用的三个主要IT服务领域:知识共享(wiki、协作编辑平台和公共网站)，沟通和解决问题(邮件列表、论坛和实时聊天)，以及代码开发和分发(代码存储库和bug跟踪)。在内部提供这些工具的部分或者全部，能为开源开发提供适当的支持。然而，这可能与组织现行的整体IT策略相冲突。如果出现这种情况，应重点解决这些冲突，并允许开源开发人员使用熟悉的工具。

Track developer code contributions
==================================

跟踪开发人员的代码贡献
==================================

Create an internal system to keep track of developer contributions and
impact. Contributions can include upstream development, supporting
product teams, knowledge transfer (mentoring, training), visibility
(publications, talks), launching new open source projects, and
establishing internal collaboration projects with other teams or
groups.

搭建一个内部系统来跟踪开发人员的贡献和影响。贡献可以包括上游开发、支持产品团队、知识转移(指导、培训)、知名度(出版物、演讲)、启动新的开源项目，以及与其他团队或小组建立内部协作项目。

With this data, you can compare contributions from various internal
development teams to identify where source code contributions are
coming from.

根据这些数据，我们就可以把来自不同内部开发团队的贡献进行比较，以确定源代码贡献的来源。

For instance, you can use these metrics to compare your performance to
other organizations involved in the Kernel ecosystem. This approach
helps better inform you about the overall developer ecosystem for the
project. In addition, these metrics provide a much better idea of your
strengths and weaknesses and can help inform your overall development
strategy.

例如，我们可以利用这些参数，与Kernel生态系统中的其他组织进行性能方面的比较。这种方法可以帮助我们更好地了解项目开发人员的整体生态系统。还可以更好地了解自身的优势和不足，从而影响整体开发策略。

 Identify focus areas with a broad impact
========================================

确定具有广泛影响的重点领域
========================================

Contribute to and focus on areas that benefit more than one business
unit or more than one product. This contribution model, driven by the
criticality of software components, allows you to provide value and
show return on investment  across multiple business units, increasing your chances for more
funding and support.

致力并专注于能让多个业务单元或多个产品受益的领域。这个基于软件重要性驱动的贡献模型可以帮助我们提供价值并掌握横跨数个业务单元的投资回报，从而有机会获得更多资金和支持。

Foster internal collaboration
=============================

提供内部协作
=============================

Create collaboration projects with other business units that use the
specific open source projects in their products. These collaborations
can take one or more of many forms:

与其他在产品中使用特定开源项目的业务单元创建协作项目。这些合作可以采取一种或多种形式:

- Deliver training to their developers.

- 为开发人员提供培训。

- Run a workshop on a specific topic or problem.

- 举办针对特定主题或问题的研讨会。

- Develop new functionality.

- 开发新功能。

- Troubleshoot and resolve issues and bugs.

- 排除以及解决问题和 bug 。

- Upstream existing code for which they lack resources.

- 对缺乏资源的代码向上溯源。

- Help get them off an old fork and onto a mainline version.

- 帮助他们从一个旧的分支到一个主线版本。

These collaborations aim to help the product teams understand their
needs and fulfill their product goals via open source enablement.

这些协作旨在帮助产品团队理解他们的需求，并通过开放源代码实现其产品目标。
