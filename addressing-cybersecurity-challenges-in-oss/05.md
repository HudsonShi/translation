## Too many organizations are not prepared to address OSS security needs
## 太多组织没有准备好应对开源软件安全需求

Across the 500+ organizations participating in this OpenSSF survey, at least 34% did not have an OSS security policy in place (Figure 1). The percentage of organizations without a security policy is likely to be around 40% after prorating those respondents who didn't know the status of an OSS security policy for their employer. OSS use is pervasive across end-user organizations and IT vendors/service providers (who somewhat evenly comprise our sample) and the 60/40 yes/no split on having an OSS security policy persists across virtually all 22 industries represented in our sample. This indicates that not having an OSS security policy is not specific to certain industries or organization types but instead is widely found across business environments.

在参与本次 OpenSSF 调查的 500 多个组织中，至少有 34％没有制定开源软件（OSS）安全策略（图 1）。在按比例计算那些不知道其雇主的 OSS 安全策略状况的受访者后，没有安全策略的组织比例可能达到 40％左右。OSS 在终端用户组织和 IT 供应商 / 服务提供商中普及（它们在样本中几乎均衡），而在我们样本中代表的几乎所有 22 个行业中，60/40 的有 / 无 OSS 安全策略分布均存在。这表明，没有 OSS 安全策略不是特定于某些行业或组织类型，而是广泛存在于商业环境中。

## Small organizations must prioritize developing an OSS security
## 小型组织必须优先考虑制定开源软件安全政策

In the wake of numerous high-profile attacks across the software supply chain over the last several years, this finding is disappointing. Every organization needs to have a CISO and OSPO (open source Program Office) or a person or persons vested with key CIS and OSPO responsibilities.
We recognize that small organizations with less than 500 people were significantly more likely to not have an OSS security policy (Figure
2). Small organizations, therefore, need to prioritize and limit their CISO and OSPO agenda so it can be achievable with a partial FT. Once key CISO and OSPO capabilities are resident in the organization an OSS security policy will follow.

在过去几年中，软件供应链遭受了许多高调攻击，这一发现令人失望。每个组织都需要有一位 CISO（首席信息安全官）和 OSPO（开源项目办公室）或一位或多位负责关键 CIS 和 OSPO 职责的人员。
我们认识到，少于 500 人的小型组织更有可能没有 OSS 安全策略（图 2）。因此，小型组织需要优先考虑并限制其 CISO 和 OSPO 议程，以使其成为部分全职任务。一旦关键的 CISO 和 OSPO 能力在组织中得到了落实，OSS 安全策略就会随之而来。

## Using additional security tools is a leading way to improve osS security
## 使用更多的安全工具是提高开源软件安全性的一种主要方式

There are at least 10 tool categories that have a focus on addressing OSS security. Organizations on average use 2.8 security tool categories among the survey options. SCA and SAST tools are the leading tools used to address OSS security among those options (Figure 14). The use of IaC tools (which indirectly address security) and web application scanners (part of the DAST category) round out the portfolio that many organizations use.

至少有 10 个工具类别专注于解决 OSS 安全问题。在调查选项中，组织平均使用 2.8 个安全工具类别。SCA 和 SAST 工具是解决 OSS 安全问题中最常用的工具（见图 14）。使用 IaC 工具（间接解决安全问题）和 Web 应用程序扫描器（DAST 类别的一部分）是许多组织使用的其他工具。

The security tools market has numerous tool categories because the overall domain extends from source code management through build, package, delivery, and deployment. This is basically the entire software lifecycle. Software security must be managed across each step and accomplishing all of this with just two or three tool categories is not feasible. Therefore, organizations should take a closer look at adjacent and complementary security tools markets and determine where incremental tools can add the most value.

安全工具市场拥有众多的工具类别，因为整个领域从源代码管理到构建、打包、交付和部署都有涉及，基本上涵盖了整个软件生命周期。必须在每个步骤上管理软件安全性，但仅使用两到三个工具类别来完成所有这些工作是不可行的。因此，组织应更加关注邻近和补充的安全工具市场，并确定增量工具可以增加最大的价值的地方。

Figure 14 also shows that organizations with an OSS security policy have a higher frequency of security tool use than those organizations without an OSS security policy. This same dynamic is in place based on organizational size where large organizations have a higher frequency of security tool use than small organizations. Security tool use is therefore one of the most obvious and powerful ways to improve your OSS security posture.

图 14 还显示，具有 OSS 安全策略的组织比没有 OSS 安全策略的组织更频繁地使用安全工具。同样，大型组织比小型组织使用安全工具的频率更高。因此，使用安全工具是改善 OSS 安全姿态最明显、最强大的方法之一。

## Collaborate with vendors to create more intelligent security tools
## 与供应商合作创建更智能的安全工具
Adding greater intelligence to existing software security tools is viewed by organizations as one of the most important ways to improve OSS security across the supply chain (Figure 15). While tool vendors may see this more as business as usual, tool users see this as a critical requirement to empower existing resources.
Because most end-user organizations are resource constrained in IT, a critical objective is to find ways that existing developers can be more productive without adding to their workload. Increased tool intelligence and automation are examples of how to improve software security in a way nearly transparent to developers.

对于组织来说，将现有软件安全工具加强智能化是提高整个供应链中的开源软件（OSS）安全性的最重要途径之一（图 15）。虽然工具供应商可能认为这是日常工作，但工具用户认为这是赋予现有资源的关键要求。
由于大多数终端用户组织在 IT 方面受到资源限制，因此一个关键目标是找到可以使现有开发人员在不增加工作量的情况下更加高效的方法。增强工具的智能化和自动化就是如何在几乎不影响开发人员的情况下提高软件安全性的例子。

## Implementing best practices for secure software development is the other leading way to improve OSS security
## 实施安全软件开发的最佳实践是另一种改善开源软件安全的主要途径

Understanding best practices for secure software development is identified repeatedly as the leading or a leading way to improve the security of the open source software supply chain (Figures 15 and 16). A primary reason why there is so much interest in best practices is that developing secure software encompasses the entire breadth of the software lifecycle. At each waypoint, from source code management, build services, and packaging to software delivery and deployment there are numerous best practices that need to be followed. This includes literally hundreds of best practices. The Linux Foundation has developed an outstanding free course and certification on developing secure software (LFD121) which can be found on OpenSSF.org.

在图 15 和 16 中，反复提到了了解安全软件开发的最佳实践是提高开源软件供应链安全的主要或领先方法之一。主要原因是开发安全软件涵盖了整个软件生命周期的所有方面。在每个航点，从源代码管理、构建服务和打包到软件交付和部署，都需要遵循众多的最佳实践。这包括数百个最佳实践。Linux Foundation 开发了一门卓越的免费课程和安全软件开发认证（LFD121），可在 OpenSSF.org 上找到。

Use automation to reduce your attack surface

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools provide a way to script manual activities so that they can be automated (Figure 15). Reducing or eliminating manual command line-driven CI/CD activities provides fewer ways for developers to skirt policy, bend rules, make mistakes, and expose CI/CD activities to external threats. Use of IaC tools and lad scanners provides organizations with a way to streamline and automate CI/CD activities while simultaneously eliminating some threat vectors, While there will always be use cases for manual intervention by developers, minimizing the need for this is a best practice,

Consumers of open source software should give back to the Communities that support them

The introduction to this paper mentioned that open source software is at a crossroads. Those open source projects that experience significant growth must evolve from their modest and somewhat informal origin to address a more demanding and security conscious community of users. This transition does not come easily because it requires increased resources, time, processes, and security. The use of open source software has often been a one-way street where users see significant benefit with minimal cost or investment. In order for larger open source projects to meet user expectations it will be important for organizations to give back and close the loop to improve open source software sustainability. Employers need to provide additional incentives to employees who have material maintainer or core contributor open source roles or responsibilities. This would also serve to encourage a higher level of participation by developers in open source projects to ensure the flow of new talent.
