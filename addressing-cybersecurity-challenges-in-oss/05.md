Conclusions and recommendations
Too many organizations are not prepared to address OSS security needs

Across the 500+ organizations participating in this OpenSSF survey, at least 34% did not have an OSS security policy in place (Figure 1). The percentage of organizations without a security policy is likely to be around 40% after prorating those respondents who didn't know the status of an OSS security policy for their employer. OSS use is pervasive across end-user organizations and IT vendors/service providers (who somewhat evenly comprise our sample) and the 60/40 yes/no split on having an OSS security policy persists across virtually all 22 industries represented in our sample. This indicates that not having an OSS security policy is not specific to certain industries or organization types but instead is widely found across business environments.

Small organizations must prioritize developing an OSS security

In the wake of numerous high-profile attacks across the software supply chain over the last several years, this finding is disappointing. Every organization needs to have a CISO and OSPO (open source Program Office) or a person or persons vested with key CIS and OSPO responsibilities.
We recognize that small organizations with less than 500 people were significantly more likely to not have an OSS security policy (Figure
2). Small organizations, therefore, need to prioritize and limit their CISO and OSPO agenda so it can be achievable with a partial FT. Once key CISO and OSPO capabilities are resident in the organization an OSS security policy will follow.

Using additional security tools is a leading way to improve osS security

There are at least 10 tool categories that have a focus on addressing OSS security. Organizations on average use 2.8 security tool categories among the survey options. SCA and SAST tools are the leading tools used to address OSS security among those options (Figure 14). The use of IaC tools (which indirectly address security) and web application scanners (part of the DAST category) round out the portfolio that many organizations use.
The security tools market has numerous tool categories because the overall domain extends from source code management through build, package, delivery, and deployment. This is basically the entire software lifecycle. Software security must be managed across each step and accomplishing all of this with just two or three tool categories is not feasible. Therefore, organizations should take a closer look at adjacent and complementary security tools markets and determine where incremental tools can add the most value.

Figure 14 also shows that organizations with an OSS security policy have a higher frequency of security tool use than those organizations without an OSS security policy. This same dynamic is in place based on organizational size where large organizations have a higher frequency of security tool use than small organizations. Security tool use is therefore one of the most obvious and powerful ways to improve your OSS security posture.


Collaborate with vendors to create more intelligent security tools

Adding greater intelligence to existing software security tools is viewed by organizations as one of the most important ways to improve OSS security across the supply chain (Figure 15). While tool vendors may see this more as business as usual, tool users see this as a critical requirement to empower existing resources.
Because most end-user organizations are resource constrained in IT, a critical objective is to find ways that existing developers can be more productive without adding to their workload. Increased tool intelligence and automation are examples of how to improve software security in a way nearly transparent to developers.

Implementing best practices for secure software development is the other leading way to improve OSS security

Understanding best practices for secure software development is identified repeatedly as the leading or a leading way to improve the security of the open source software supply chain (Figures 15 and 16). A primary reason why there is so much interest in best practices is that developing secure software encompasses the entire breadth of the software lifecycle. At each waypoint, from source code management, build services, and packaging to software delivery and deployment there are numerous best practices that need to be followed. This includes literally hundreds of best practices. The Linux Foundation has developed an outstanding free course and certification on developing secure software (LFD121) which can be found on OpenSSF.org.

Use automation to reduce your attack surface

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools provide a way to script manual activities so that they can be automated (Figure 15). Reducing or eliminating manual command line-driven CI/CD activities provides fewer ways for developers to skirt policy, bend rules, make mistakes, and expose CI/CD activities to external threats. Use of IaC tools and lad scanners provides organizations with a way to streamline and automate CI/CD activities while simultaneously eliminating some threat vectors, While there will always be use cases for manual intervention by developers, minimizing the need for this is a best practice,

Consumers of open source software should give back to the Communities that support them

The introduction to this paper mentioned that open source software is at a crossroads. Those open source projects that experience significant growth must evolve from their modest and somewhat informal origin to address a more demanding and security conscious community of users. This transition does not come easily because it requires increased resources, time, processes, and security. The use of open source software has often been a one-way street where users see significant benefit with minimal cost or investment. In order for larger open source projects to meet user expectations it will be important for organizations to give back and close the loop to improve open source software sustainability. Employers need to provide additional incentives to employees who have material maintainer or core contributor open source roles or responsibilities. This would also serve to encourage a higher level of participation by developers in open source projects to ensure the flow of new talent.
