Addressing Cybersecurity
Challenges in Open Source
Software

Open source software (OSS) has become an integral part of the technology landscape, as inseparable from the digital machinery of modern society as bridges and highways are from global transportation infrastructure. According to one report, typically 70% to 90% of a modern application stack consists of pre-existing OSS, from the operating system to the cloud container to the cryptography and networking functions, sometimes up to the very application running your enterprise or website. Thanks to copyright licenses that encourage no-charge re-use, remixing, and redistribution, OSS encourages even the most dogged of competitors to work together to address common challenges, saving money by avoiding duplication of effort, moving faster to innovate upon new ideas and adopt emerging standards. 

However, this ubiquity and flexibility can come at a price. While OSS generally has an excellent reputation for security, the communities behind those works can vary significantly in their application of development practices and techniques to reduce the risk of defects in the code, or to respond quickly and safely when one is discovered by others. Often, developers trying to decide what OSS to use have difficulty determining which ones are more likely to be secure than others based on objective criteria.
Enterprises often don't have a well-managed inventory of the software assets they use, with enough granular detail, to know when or if they're vulnerable to known defects, and when or how to upgrade. Even those enterprises willing to invest in increasing the security of the OSS they use often don't know where to make those investments, nor their urgency relative to other priorities.

However, fighting security issues at their upstream source trying to catch them earlier in the development process, or even reduce the chances of their occurrence at all - remains a critical need. We are also seeing new attacks that focus less on vulnerabilities in code, and more on the supply chain itself - from rogue software that uses "typosquatting on package names to insert itself unexpectedly into a developer's dependency tree, to attacks on software build and distribution services, to developers turning their one-person projects into "protest-ware" with likely unintended consequences.

Enterprises often don't have a well-managed inventory of the software assets they use, with enough granular detail, to know when or if they're vulnerable to known defects, and when or how to upgrade. Even those enterprises willing to invest in increasing the security of the OSS they use often don't know where to make those investments, nor their urgency relative to other priorities.

To address the urgent need for better security practices, tools, and techniques in the open source software ecosystem, a collection of deeply invested organizations came together in 2020 to form the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF), and chose to house that effort at the Linux Foundation. This public effort has grown to include hundreds of active participants across dozens of different public initiatives housed under 7 working groups, with funding and partnership from over 75 different organizations, and reaching millions of OSS developers. This report presents analysis that we intend to use to help support that effort.
