Methodology

The objective of this research was to understand the following:

The current state of open source software security

•Security practices across the open source software supply chain

• Secure development practices
•How the security and sustainability of open source software can be improved

This research project was initiated in 2022 01 at the request of the OpenSSF. The primary research vehicle would be a survey of OSS developers, maintainers, core contributors, and security professionals. However, the research was preceded by interviews with fifteen OSS maintainers and security subject matter experts.
These qualitative interviews were performed to ensure that the survey included key security topics important to the OSS community.

Interviews occurred in March 2022 and the survey was fielded in
April 2022. Data was analyzed and this report was drafted as well as peer reviewed in May 2022.

All Figures in this survey include results that are rounded to the nearest whole integer percent value. Therefore, totals for segmentation data may not always add to 100%.

This was a long survey with an average time to complete of 20+ minutes. The completion rate for this survey was under 50%. This explains why there is some variation in the sample size for the above segmentation variables.

Compretensstive screening enteria were to ensure respondents wouildi have a thigh probability of being able to answer all survey questions. Screening criteria included involvement im open source software, experience in the development or use of open source software, employed or looking for employment, and respondents who self-identify as a real person.

The qualitative dimension of this project included in-depth interviews with selected individuals across industries and in federal cybersecurity policy development or involvement with maintaining open source software.
