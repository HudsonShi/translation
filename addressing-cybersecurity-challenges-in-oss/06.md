# Methodology
# 方法

The objective of this research was to understand the following:
* The current state of open source software security
* Security practices across the open source software supply chain
* Secure development practices
* How the security and sustainability of open source software can be improved

本研究的目的是了解以下内容：
* 开源软件安全的当前状态
* 开源软件供应链中的安全实践
* 安全开发实践
* 如何改善开源软件的安全性和可持续性

This research project was initiated in 2022 01 at the request of the OpenSSF. The primary research vehicle would be a survey of OSS developers, maintainers, core contributors, and security professionals. However, the research was preceded by interviews with fifteen OSS maintainers and security subject matter experts.
These qualitative interviews were performed to ensure that the survey included key security topics important to the OSS community.

此研究项目于 2022 年 1 月应 OpenSSF 的请求启动。主要的研究手段是对开源软件开发人员、维护者、核心贡献者和安全专业人员进行调查。
在进行调查之前，进行了 15 次与开源软件维护者和安全专家的定性访谈，以确保调查包含开源社区中重要的安全主题。

Interviews occurred in March 2022 and the survey was fielded in April 2022. Data was analyzed and this report was drafted as well as peer reviewed in May 2022.

访谈在 2022 年 3 月进行，调查在 2022 年 4 月进行。数据分析和本报告的起草及同行评审在 2022 年 5 月完成。

All Figures in this survey include results that are rounded to the nearest whole integer percent value. Therefore, totals for segmentation data may not always add to 100%.

本调查中的所有图表结果均按最接近的整数百分比值四舍五入。因此，分段数据的总和可能不总是 100%。

This was a long survey with an average time to complete of 20+ minutes. The completion rate for this survey was under 50%. This explains why there is some variation in the sample size for the above segmentation variables.

本调查为长篇问卷，平均完成时间超过 20 分钟。本次调查的完成率不足 50%。这就解释了上述分段变量样本大小存在一定变异性的原因。

Compretensstive screening enteria were to ensure respondents wouildi have a thigh probability of being able to answer all survey questions. Screening criteria included involvement im open source software, experience in the development or use of open source software, employed or looking for employment, and respondents who self-identify as a real person.

为确保受访者有可能回答所有调查问题，采用了综合筛选标准。筛选标准包括参与开源软件、开源软件的开发或使用经验、在职或寻找工作以及自我确认为真实人士的受访者。

The qualitative dimension of this project included in-depth interviews with selected individuals across industries and in federal cybersecurity policy development or involvement with maintaining open source software.

本项目的定性维度包括深入访谈跨行业的个人以及在联邦网络安全政策制定或维护开源软件方面有参与的个人。
